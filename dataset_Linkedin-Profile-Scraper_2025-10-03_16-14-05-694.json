She fostered a culture of collaboration, accountability, and continuous improvement, always encouraging team members to bring forward ideas and take ownership of their work. Her ability to navigate complex challenges with calm, clarity, and decisiveness was truly inspiring.\n\nOne of the most meaningful aspects of my time working with Laurie was the way she helped pave the path for my own career as a facility leader. Through her mentorship, I gained not only technical knowledge but also the confidence and perspective needed to lead effectively. She modeled what it means to lead with integrity, compassion, and purpose—qualities I strive to emulate in my own leadership today.\n\nHer investment in my development went beyond day-to-day guidance; she challenged me to grow, supported me through transitions, and celebrated my successes as if they were her own. I am a better leader because of Laurie, and I carry forward the lessons I learned from her in every aspect of my work.\n\nI am deeply grateful for the opportunity to have worked with such an exceptional leader and would wholeheartedly recommend Laurie for any role that demands vision, dedication, and the ability to bring out the best in others.\n\nSincerely,\nHatti Carlson\nManager, Facilities Engineering\nMercy and Unity Hospital, part of Allina Health"

Parmetech was tasked with a major transition project that involved all areas of the health system and the technology teams led by Tara were extremely qualified in completing this endeavor. They exceeded our expectations and all KPIs associated with the project. Tara was also acknowledged by many in our IT Project Management team for her due diligence and for overcoming the many \"scope creeps\" that were inevitable with such a large and impactful project.\n\n\"Going above and beyond\" is an understatement when referring to Tara.

He reported to another Manager in Crozer's Supply Chain, but Jeff again proved that his professionalism, experience and dedicated work ethic were a valued addition to the that organization.  Jeff is a hard-working, reliable individual who never says \"no\" to any challenge that came his way (and there were many).  From his work during the Pope visit during 2015, to being an integral part of a complete revamping of the antiquated inventory processes at Crozer.  A true team player!  "

              "text": "The placental extracellular matrix (ECM) dynamically remodels over pregnancy and in disease. How these changes impact placental barrier function is poorly understood as there are limited in vitro models of the placenta with a modifiable stromal compartment to mechanistically investigate these extracellular factors. We developed a straightforward method to incorporate uniform hydrogels into standard cell culture inserts for transplacental transport studies. Uniform polyacrylamide (PAA) gels were polymerized within cell culture inserts by (re)using the insert packaging to create a closed, controllable environmental chamber. PAA pre-polymer solution was added dropwise via a syringe to the cell culture insert and the atmosphere was purged with an inert gas. Transport and cell culture studies were conducted to validate the model. We successfully incorporated ECM-functionalized uniform PAA gels into cell culture inserts, enabling cell adhesion and monolayer formation. Imaging and analyte transport studies validated gel formation and expected mass transport results, and successful cell studies confirmed cell viability, stiffness-mediated YAP translocation, and that the model could be used in transplacental transport studies. Detailed methods and validation protocols are included. The incorporation of a PAA gel within a cell culture insert enables independent study of placental ECM biophysical and biochemical properties in the context of transplacental transport. These straightforward and low-cost methods to build three-dimensional cellular models are readily adoptable by the wider scientific community."

              "text": "Generation of in vitro tissue models with serially perfused hierarchical vasculature would allow greater control of fluid perfusion throughout the network and enable direct mechanistic investigation of vasculogenesis, angiogenesis, and vascular remodeling. In this work, we have developed a method to produce a closed, serially perfused, multiscale vessel network fully embedded within an acellular hydrogel, where flow through the capillary bed is required prior to fluid exit. We confirmed that the acellular and cellular gel-gel interface was functionally annealed without preventing or biasing cell migration and endothelial self-assembly. Multiscale connectivity of the vessel network was validated via high-resolution microscopy techniques to confirm anastomosis between self-assembled and patterned vessels. Lastly, using a simple acrylic cassette and fluorescently labeled microspheres, the multiscale network was demonstrated to be perfusable. Directed flow from inlet to outlet mandated flow through the capillary bed. This method for producing closed, multiscale vascular networks was developed with the intention of straightforward fabrication and engineering techniques so as to be a low barrier to entry for researchers who wish to investigate mechanistic questions in vascular biology. This ease of use offers a facile extension of these methods for incorporation into organoid culture, organ-on-a-chip (OOC) models, and bioprinted tissues."

I went into the process with much trepidation, having never sold a house before, and Janet made the process as painless as possible.  Thanks to Janet, I came away with a better deal and in a shorter amount of time than I had thought possible.  She was very responsive to all my questions and needs.

  "about": "After graduating from Lafayette College, I received my medical degree from the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine.  I completed my Internal Medicine Residency at Lankenau Medical Center and I am board certified by the American Board of Internal Medicine.  I have been in practice at Lankenau Medical Center since 2005, and recently joined the MDVIP national physician network, the largest membership-based primary care network in the country.  In this model, I strive to deliver personalized, patient-centered medical care with an emphasis on prevention.  \n\nI currently teach in the nurse practitioner program at Villanova University, have served as a medical correspondent for MGM studios, as On-Air Talent for the Biotechnology Innovation Organization, and frequently serve as a spokesman for local news channels.  I am the founder and CEO of HealthCare Security Innovations and the Chief Medical Officer of Kognition.  Having served as a healthcare worker on the front lines of the Covid-19 pandemic, I believe firmly in the importance of AI-driven technology to improve health and safety in hospital systems.  ",

How we respond to the challenges of Covid-19 will define us as a country.  Reopening society safely is critical to both our health, our livelihoods, and our economy.  \n\nKognition's novel AI-driven technology platform can make these goals a reality.   The system, which can be incorporated into a building's existing security infrastructure, can adapt to changing societal manifestations and be customized to the intricacies of any organization.  Whether implemented in hospitals, essential businesses, arenas, or even malls, Kognition's platform has limitless potential.\n\nKognition’s scalable, software-defined Smart Property System interconnects assets,\npersonnel and operations, allowing processes to be measured, automated and optimized, thereby enabling hospitals or other businesses to be more competitive, more intelligent and more secure.  \n\nIn addition to facial recognition capability, asset and people tracking as well as threat detection, the system has been upgraded to assist in the fight against coronavirus.  Once executed, the platform can detect individuals with fever, utilizing FDA-approved FLIR thermal cameras.  Utilizing already- existing camera infrastructure, the system can determine if social distancing guidelines are being practiced, can perform expeditious contact tracing, touch-less entry, and even provide real–time active intelligence for threat detection.  \n\nUltimately, this platform will turn any building into a Smart Healthy Property.   It can be modified to each specific organization and be taught to do nearly anything it is asked to do. To that end, the system will improve safety and security, optimize performance, and reduce operating costs.\n"

Lankenau was founded as the German Hospital of Philadelphia over 160 years ago, and is home to the Lankenau Institute of Medical Research and a large and vibrant medical education program with over 150 residents and fellows.  We recently completed a major expansion on the 96 acre campus that was formerly home to the Overbrook Country Club, with a 500 million dollar master facility project that at its time was the largest private construction project in southeast Pennsylvania at the time.  The construction project included a new heart pavilion with all private rooms, a new power plant, a 1300 car parking garage and two new intensive care units.  More recently in 2020 we completed a new state of the art ED and Trauma center that tripled the size of our facility and vastly improved access and services to the community. Lankenau was also recently recognized as a top 50 heart hospital in the United States by Thompson Reuters/ Truven/IBM Watson for the eleventy time, and has been named by Healthgrades as a top 50 hospital in the United States for the past three years [2019, 2020 and 2021] and has been recognized by both regionally and nationally by US News and World Report and Consumer Reports for quality programs in 14 different specialty areas."

I made sure on every shift that everyone had the assistance they needed and everything was running as quickly and as smoothly as possible. If anyone needed help, I quickly jumped in.

  "about": "I am a highly experienced Clinical Research Professional with over 14 years of Clinical Research expertise working at large academic institutions and healthcare systems. \n\nI have a Bachelor of Science in Integrative Health Science, as well as a Bachelor of Art in Psychology, with a focus on Research.\n\nI am skilled in all aspects of Phase I-IV clinical trial research from study start up to publication, as well as data and clinical coordinator to project management of multiple disease groups. Lung Cancer is a specific passion of mine, after watching family members battle the disease. \n\nI strive to be present, compassionate and always learning for any position I hold. As a manager, I believe the best way to teach, grow and support others is to understand how and WHY they do their jobs, in order to foster meaningful and productive relationships. \n\nI am passionate about making research accessible to all, improving efficiency for investigators/coordinators and ‘on a mission’ to be even a small part of curing cancer. Research is personal to me - it saved my life and I want to help others in their fight, as it helped me. ",

  "about": "I’m a biotech innovation executive with over 9 years of experience translating cutting-edge science into viable therapeutics. My work sits at the intersection of discovery and commercialization, bridging translational research, venture development, and early-stage commercialization to accelerate novel drug platforms.\n\nWhether leading deep science, building ventures, or aligning innovations with market and clinical needs, I specialize in driving solutions that scale — particularly in cardiovascular and oncology therapeutics. I’ve led cross-functional programs from the lab bench to startup pitch decks, co-founded multiple biotech ventures, and collaborated across academia, pharma, and investor ecosystems to push science beyond the publication and into patient impact.\n\nI apply a systems-level mindset to innovation — from identifying unmet needs and building commercialization roadmaps to cultivating scientific partnerships and aligning IP, regulatory, and funding strategies. I bring both rigorous science and strategic clarity to every initiative I lead.\n\nCareer Highlights\n\n• Developed 20+ pre-clinical drug candidates targeting rare cardiac conditions at SFU and LIMR while building investor engagement for breakthrough cardiovascular technologies.\n• Co-founded biotech ventures AruMetis Pharmaceuticals and OncoCardia Corporation, licensing novel compounds and aligning R&D to unmet clinical needs in cardiac arrhythmias.\n• Drove disease modeling initiatives using iPSC-based stem cell platforms at Stanford University, enabling 20+ personalized screenings and producing high-impact publications.\n• Delivered medical and STEM education to 300+ students across four academic platforms, earning consistent acclaim for impactful, applied instruction.\n• Contributed to global translational science through postdoctoral and editorial leadership in cardiac electrophysiology, shaping both drug development and medical learning at scale.",

His overall expertise and past experience in datacenter facilities management was invaluable in transforming us from a small web host into a major service provider.  Gary implemented emergency processes & procedures, preventative maintenance practices and regular testing of core infrastructure which prevented problems by discovering them first.  Just about all of the processes he implemented are still in place today and have been replicated to our other five datacenters nationwide.  As a manager, Gary set expectations and held his people accountable, mindful not to get in the way of team performing the job, except when a course correction was needed.  I would be fortunate to work with Gary again in the future."

I currently work in the Emergency Department at The Children's Hospital of Philadelphia.  I love working with people and have a passion for effective and flexible teamwork. \n\nMy entrance into nursing was non-traditional in that I returned to nursing school after working for several years in other fields, primarily the solar industry.  These other work experiences provided an opportunity to learn other skills including, but not limited to, teamwork, leadership, grant writing, process management, time management, and flexibility.",

I love to tackle big challenges improving sepsis care, streamlining operations, building onboarding programs, and representing clinicians. To me, ideas are just as important as execution.\n\nI’m passionate about creating ED teams that not only work well but work well together, because better culture means better patient care. Along the way, I’ve learned that leadership isn’t about being the fastest or most intelligent doctor in the room. it’s about listening, coaching, and being grateful for the opportunity to work in the chaos.\n\nIf you are interested in proving emergency departments, patient throughput, leadership in medicine, then follow me and let's connect some ideas!"

As a executive team member for Cancer Treatment Centers of America for the last year and a half, I had the opportunity to observe Michele demonstrate all of these traits from her role as Radiation Oncology/Radiology Director.  \n\nAn educator for the business development and marketing teams in teaching the teams about our service offerings and the procedures performed that were differentiators for CTCA. A mentor to her staff and others within the organization. Michele championed the mission and ensured all employees understood the importance of projecting the mission for the patients.\n\nMichele displayed the ability to develop the business within her departments through her participation in business development initiatives. Michele developed an comparative analysis between her departments and the local market. From this effort she developed and implemented a strategic plan to drive patient volume growth.\n\nCalling Michele a doer may seem odd; however, she is a doer. Michele never sat idly by and waited for things to come to her. She  always address things as they occur and looks for additional activities to help with the support of employees and patients, creates new business opportunities and represents the organization within the community and to other groups/partners.\n\nMichele is a strong, inspirational leader that will be an asset to any organization; and, whom I strongly recommend.

I am interested in incorporating my key leadership strengths at a system level with my demonstrated ability with building relationships through collaborative communication, team building, and fiscal stewardship to reach organizational targets and metrics that demonstrate a commitment to patient safety and quality services.\nSUMMARY\nI have over seventeen years of progressive nursing leadership experience in an academic, acute care, level II trauma center with strong clinical expertise in critical care and cardiothoracic service line development.  My key strengths include strategic planning for growth, clinical expertise for patient optimization, demonstrated success with patient, physician, and employee satisfaction and complex problem solving. With my formal change management capabilities, I contributed to hospital-based and Hybrid OR construction projects, implemented two electronic documentation systems, enhanced recruitment success for nursing staff and physicians, and established sound relationships with multidisciplinary teams to successful navigate in a complex healthcare environment.\n\n"

              "text": "Abstract: Although considerable efforts have been made to incorporate simulation-based learning (SBL) in undergraduate medical education, to date, most of the medical school curricula still focus on pure knowledge or individual assessment of objective structured clinical examination skills (OSCE). To this end, we designed a case study named \"iG4 (integrated generation 4) virtual on-call (iVOC)\". We aimed to simulate an on-call shift in a high-fidelity virtual hospital setting in order to assess delegates' team-based performance on tasks related to patient handovers (prioritisation, team allocation).\n\nMethods: A total of 41 clinical year medical students were split into 3 cohorts, each of which included 3 groups of 4 or 5 people. The groups consisted of a structured mix of educational and cultural backgrounds of students to achieve homogeneity. Each performing group received the handover for 5 patients in the virtual hospital and had to identify and deal with the acutely unwell ones within 15 minutes. We used TEAMTM tool to assess team-based performances.\n\nResults: The mean handover performance was 5.44/10 ± 2.24 which was the lowest across any performance marker. The overall global performance across any team was 6.64/10 ± 2.11. The first rotating team's global performance for each cycle was 6.44/10 ± 2.01, for the second 7.89/10 ± 2.09 and for the third 6.78/10 ± 1.64 (p = 0.099 between groups).\n\nConclusion: This is one of the first reported, high-fidelity, globally reproducible SBL settings to assess the capacity of students to work as part of a multinational team, highlighting several aspects that need to be addressed during undergraduate studies. Medical schools should consider similar efforts with the aim to incorporate assessment frameworks for individual performances of students as part of a team, which can be a stepping-stone for enhancing safety in clinical practice."

Multiple surgical approaches have been analyzed in the literature for the treatment of such a challenging pathology. In this case report, we describe the surgical management of a 72-year-old man presenting with a complicated aortic arch rupture. The patient was treated urgently with a type I hybrid arch replacement in two stages, with total preservation of cerebral and systemic perfusion. Our case shows that hybrid arch methods are applicable even in emergency cases."
