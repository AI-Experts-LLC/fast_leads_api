She demonstrates exceptional skills as a team member, and in many technical and detailed job functions. She has good interpersonal skills, is adept at computer skills, works well both independently and as a group member, and is often relied on to complete complex tasks within a short time frame.  She applied her educational background in business and marketing at Providence Hospice of Seattle, a large and respected non-profit healthcare provider in Washington State, in supporting the Access Services and Business Development team.  She participated as editor on newletter publications, organized large conferences and activities for physicians and providers, and participated behind the scenes as the indvidual driving the organizational preparation for a myriad of activities.  Any company would do well to employ Christine."

I have had the pleasure of working with Jamie as a coworker, direct report, and in his previous roles as Chief Technical Officer and Strategic Partner.\n\nI worked directly for Jamie when he was the Director of IT at Medford Medical Clinic. As the director, Jamie initiated and led several infrastructure improvements including deploying virtual servers, wireless infrastructure, and Microsoft and Apple Software servers. Jamie also initiated and led meetings with with his peers at other companies to share ideas and strategies to improve services to stakeholders. Jamie cares about his employees and worked tirelessly to make sure we had the training and resources to accomplish our mission.\n\nAs a strategic partner, Jamie is excellent at working to build teams to resolve issues that arise. Hospital executives know that they can bring issues to him and he will build the team and gather resources necessary to resolve their issues quickly. Jamie cares deeply about making sure that our IT systems work and that any problems are quickly resolved. Jamie and I often picked each other's brains for ideas and solutions while he was the Chief Technology Officer at Providence University.\n\nJamie will be a great asset for the company fortunate enough to hire him. Wherever he lands, I would be the first in line to apply to work on his team if we still worked in the same area. I know that he will work to make his organization the best that it can be and those fortunate enough to work for him will be challenged to be their best."

Russ is highly driven to be a life long learner and is always willing to share his knowledge with those around him. I first met Russ in 2008 while working together in tech repair. In light of a poor work environment we always challenged each other to do our best. Russ not only lead the company in repairs but did so well he was honored by Apple as a top Apple tech. Not an easy achievement.\nYears later, after both advancing in our career's I had the opportunity to hire Russ at Medford Medical Clinic and jumped on it right away. This was one of the best decisions I've made in my leadership career thus far. Not only did Russ bring a vast amount of experience but he came with his drive to always improve. Russ's drive created a force within our department and we became one of the top IT offices in our region.\n\nTo date, the only regret I have regarding Russ is that I moved out of state and couldn't take him with.

Jamie also initiated and led meetings with with his peers at other companies to share ideas and strategies to improve services to stakeholders. Jamie cares about his employees and worked tirelessly to make sure we had the training and resources to accomplish our mission.\n\nAs a strategic partner, Jamie is excellent at working to build teams to resolve issues that arise. Hospital executives know that they can bring issues to him and he will build the team and gather resources necessary to resolve their issues quickly. Jamie cares deeply about making sure that our IT systems work and that any problems are quickly resolved. Jamie and I often picked each other's brains for ideas and solutions while he was the Chief Technology Officer at Providence University.\n\nJamie will be a great asset for the company fortunate enough to hire him. Wherever he lands, I would be the first in line to apply to work on his team if we still worked in the same area. I know that he will work to make his organization the best that it can be and those fortunate enough to work for him will be challenged to be their best."

Russ is highly driven to be a life long learner and is always willing to share his knowledge with those around him. I first met Russ in 2008 while working together in tech repair. In light of a poor work environment we always challenged each other to do our best. Russ not only lead the company in repairs but did so well he was honored by Apple as a top Apple tech. Not an easy achievement.\nYears later, after both advancing in our career's I had the opportunity to hire Russ at Medford Medical Clinic and jumped on it right away. This was one of the best decisions I've made in my leadership career thus far. Not only did Russ bring a vast amount of experience but he came with his drive to always improve. Russ's drive created a force within our department and we became one of the top IT offices in our region.\n\nTo date, the only regret I have regarding Russ is that I moved out of state and couldn't take him with.

Due to my role as a sergeant I was the leader of fifteen soldiers and was responsible for performance evaluations and offering constructive feedback to my troops. To be an effective leader in the Army I maintained strong problem solving skills with the ability to work collaboratively within diverse groups while performing in difficult and stressful situations. In addition, I displayed critical reasoning, math skills and was capable of applying them effectively by thinking quickly on my feet making tough decisions independently and showing good judgment in directing team members as needed. I was able to accomplish this by having advanced knowledge, technical skills, excellent verbal communication skills and I was capable of adapting to situations containing violence and emotional instability in multicultural settings."

There are always skills to acquire, facts to learn, and character traits to further develop. I take great pride in my commitment to pushing myself beyond my previous limits. This constant pushing has led to trust and praise everywhere I have been. I easily win the respect of my peers and supervisors through my unyielding work ethic, independence, and calm, reliable nature.\n\nCliftonStrengths: Adaptability, Empathy, Restorative, Intellection, Connectedness",

I've heard more than one of his employees that they felt more supported and empowered to do their best work as a result of his leadership. \n\nMy interactions were reflective of his steadfast approach to providing his team a roadmap to success. I always felt like a partner in this vision - which is highly motivating. I walked away from all interactions feeling respected, appreciated and clear on the need and plan. \n\nIn a high pressure, ever changing field - George's calm under pressure, analytical approach in which he solicits others thoughts/feedback is refreshing and allows for true innovative ideas.

There were several tasks we requested of him and his team which included validation of hardware deployment and configuration and testing of all workstations. During the main event for testing Johnny and his team Johnny and his team did a great job working around patient care and caregivers as this was a production environment in an active hospital.

During the time we worked together my role was a Principal Project Manager and later a Senior Manager of a team that was heavily involved with the implementation of the Epic electronic medical record for Covenant Health in Texas and New Mexico. My direct reports interacted with Alvin daily and I served as an escalation point for the holistic project.\n\nAlvin is professional, accountable, and possesses a passion for the details and customer satisfaction. In his role as an IS Project Manager he was responsible to attend and report out progress and barriers daily, communicate directly with the clinical caregivers when scheduling and entering their workspace. The clinical environment takes compassion and empathy; both of which Alvin displays. \n\nOther key skills would be his ability to develop relationships and trust with the key stakeholders and team members. This was accomplished by being accountable, knowledgeable, flexible, and approachable. Any organization would be lucky to have him."

There were several tasks we requested of him and his team which included validation of hardware deployment and configuration and testing of all workstations. During the main event for testing Johnny and his team Johnny and his team did a great job working around patient care and caregivers as this was a production environment in an active hospital. His demeanor with peers and colleagues was exemplary and if we had an opening on our team, I am confident we would have gladly recruited him to work for us.

In his role as an IS Project Manager he was responsible to attend and report out progress and barriers daily, communicate directly with the clinical caregivers when scheduling and entering their workspace. The clinical environment takes compassion and empathy; both of which Alvin displays. \n\nOther key skills would be his ability to develop relationships and trust with the key stakeholders and team members.

This helps me understand the \"why\" behind a lot of our tasks and solve problems effectively and efficiently.  I thoroughly enjoy working with the Epic EMR system and training others to use it as well. It is fulfilling to be able to educate my team and encourage them in a way that empowers them to be successful in their own roles. My team appreciates that I am willing to get in the trenches with them and lead by example. Their trust in my leadership is what gets me out of bed in the morning. I have a passion for patient care and experience and I'm always on the lookout for forward movement with a company dedicated to quality and great customer service.",

Brian also effectively managed and maintained the project budget, he communicated all potential issues to the team and kept everyone actively engaged in creative problem solving.

While many courses in manufacturing focus on the mechanical operations and processes, this certificate focuses on maximizing the performance of the entire system. Achieving the highest levels of performance starts with design of products and systems, integrating the contributions of a complex network of suppliers, and coordinating production according to key constraints throughout the supply chain. Finally, the most effective route to achieving continuous improvement in this environment is the integrated application of Lean, Six Sigma, and Theory of Constraints."

Darren is a champion of strong morals and ethics, combined with customer service. As such, he was always promoting our team of managers to do the right thing. He led our group through some difficult decisions and always put the patients and employee safety first. We saw situations where caregivers were being injured during patient lifting scenarios. Darren supported equipment repairs, tracking/metrics, and the injury prevention program. Darren could be seen fostering connections throughout the day with patients and caregivers on a personal level and he genuinely cares for those around him.  He has strong core values and leadership skills that are exemplary. I highly recommend Darren, he is a highly motivated, action-oriented, results driven leader."

Brian worked with us on several large initiatives including a large Teaching-Health Clinic and a ground-up 100 bed inpatient behavioral health hospital. Brian brings multiple skills to the table and is able to manage complex multiphase projects with various contracting styles (IPD, GMP, Lump Sum, Lean IPD, Design/Build ). Brian also effectively managed and maintained the project budget, he communicated all potential issues to the team and kept everyone actively engaged in creative problem solving. If our healthcare system ever looked to build any large design build campus I would request we engage Brian and his team as their skill set has proven to be second to none."
