En el año 2003 con la ayuda de mi esposo y el apoyo de mis padres, comencé a estudiar tiempo completo y logré terminar en el 2004 mi grado de bachillerato en enfermería.
En diciembre de 2004 comencé a trabajar en el Departamento de Sala de Emergencias del Hospital Comunitario Buen Samaritano donde me enriquecí  profesionalmente. Hoy día agradezco la oportunidad que me brindaron de expandir mis conocimiento. En enero de 2010 decidí renunciar y establecer la meta de comenzar mi Maestría en Enfermería.
En febrero de 2010 fui empleada en Atlantis Healthcare Group – Aguadilla Renal Center. En la compañía me ofrecieron un entrenamiento de tres meses para trabajar con enfermera de hemodiálisis y al terminar el entrenamiento ejercí satisfactoriamente. 
En el enero de 2011 se me permitió estudiar a tiempo parcial una “Maestría en Enfermería Médico Quirúrgico con la Especialidad en Cuidado Crítico y Rol Educativo”, mientras trabajaba en su compañía, conocían que mi aspiración era ser profesora de enfermería. En diciembre de 2013 terminé mi maestría y en enero 2014 decidí renunciar muy agradecida por la oportunidad que me brindaron.
En el año 2014 y hasta el presente tengo la oportunidad de impartir la enseñanza en el área de la enfermería. Entre las universidades que me han brindado la oportunidad se encuentran la Universidad de Puerto Rico (Recinto Arecibo U.P.R.A. / Colegio Mayagüez R.U.M.) y la Universidad Interamericana de Puerto Rico (Recinto Aguadilla). 
Mis objetivos hacia el futuro es comenzar y culminar un Doctorado en Enfermería, que en el tiempo preciso se cumplirá.
