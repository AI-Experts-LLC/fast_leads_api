My 3 hallmarks of a successful leader are: having a vision and clear intent; knowing how to communicate it; and remaining approachable with the team to show support and engage in problem solving as necessary.

My 3 hallmarks of a successful leader are: having a vision and clear intent; knowing how to communicate it; and remaining approachable with the team to show support and engage in problem solving as necessary.  COL Chris Castle possesses all 3 of these hallmarks and I would gladly work with him again on any project or in any organization.  "
