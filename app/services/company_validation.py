Analyze these LinkedIn prospects to determine if they CURRENTLY work at "{target_company}" or its variations.

CRITICAL VALIDATION RULES:
1. CURRENT EMPLOYMENT ONLY - Reject if they previously worked there but moved to a different company
2. COMPANY NAME VARIATIONS - Accept variations like:
   - "UCI Medical Center" = "UCI Health" = "UC Irvine Health" = "University of California Irvine Health"
   - "Mayo Clinic" = "Mayo Clinic Health System" = "Mayo One"
   - "Johns Hopkins" = "Johns Hopkins Medicine" = "Johns Hopkins Hospital"
   - "Cleveland Clinic" = "Cleveland Clinic Foundation"
3. DIVISION/SUBSIDIARY MATCHING - Accept if they work at a division/subsidiary of the target company
4. KEYWORD ANALYSIS - Look for employment indicators in job descriptions, not just company names

Target Company: {target_company}

Prospects to validate:
{json.dumps(prospects, indent=2)}

For each prospect, analyze:
- LinkedIn title format: "Name - Job Title at Company" 
- LinkedIn snippet: Job description and current role details
- Employment timeline indicators (current vs. past tense)
- Company name variations and subsidiaries

Return JSON with this exact structure:
{{
  "validation_results": [
    {{
      "index": 0,
      "currently_employed": true,
      "confidence_score": 95,

      "company_match_type": "exact_match|variation|subsidiary|division",

    "employment_verified": 2,

  }}
}}

SCORING CRITERIA (0-100 confidence):
- 90-100: Clear current employment with exact/obvious company match
- 70-89: Strong indicators of current employment with company variation match
- 50-69: Probable current employment but some uncertainty
- 30-49: Uncertain employment status or weak company connection
- 0-29: Likely past employment or different company

Only mark "currently_employed": true for confidence scores â‰¥ 70.
