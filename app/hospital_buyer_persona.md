Transcript:
 
Them: Back in milwaukee. Yeah. Yeah. Nice. Hey, guys. How's it going? Good.  
Me: I'm not sure if I met everyone on this call already.  
Them: I don't believe we've met.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: My name is Kevin Glauber I'm an energy engineer here with metrics.  
Me: Fantastic. Nice to meet you, Kevin. I'm Lucas.  
Them: Yeah, nice feature, Lucas.  
Me: With AI Experts. Com just helping businesses adopt automation.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: So.  
Them: Yeah. Kevin. Oh, sorry. Yeah, go ahead. Go ahead, guys. Kevin, I don't think we've met either. Andrew Ciardella It's great to meet you. Just signed my contract literally 20 minutes ago. I'm going to be working. Oh, really? On the business development team. Yeah, Tara just sent me the latest version.  
Me: Oh, go ahead.  
Them: So if you join any of you guys in full time capacity at about three, three, four weeks, Okay. Good deal. So, yeah, I take it you'll be out with us in October, then? Yeah, that's the point. Okay, good deal. No, it's good to meet you. This is the earliest I've met a new footworker. That's great. I'll be out there. I've got travel book six through the ninth. All right. Sweet. Yeah, looking forward to that. Well, congratulations. Hot off the press. Yeah. What's your. Brand new. Yeah. What's your official start date? September 22nd. Okay. So, got another month yet? Yeah. Yeah, a couple weeks. Yeah. Ben just wanted me to help with some of the AI stuff. Then. I used to work together at our last job. Okay, gotcha. Do you get a little bit of time off between, or are you just from. One good deal. Yeah. Yeah, a week. Yeah, a little bit of time would be good. Just, you know, it's hard. These opportunities rarely come around, so to get genuine time offers like, nothing, nothing going on. So, yeah, where you're not worried about what's coming next, but. Yeah, you have no, no responsibilities. But you know that you. Yeah, it's. It's nice to me. It's like it clears the plate. You know, it's weird to have, like a to do list from the. From the previous employer. And then, you know, Monday morning, it's like, oh, I'm on something else now, so. No, that's great.  
Me: Yeah. Are you going somewhere, Andrew, or are you going to just stay put and enjoy?  
Them: You know what? I don't know. Now that it's all finalized, I might. I don't know. I got to look into some stuff. There's an Air Canada strike that just finished, so I can travel again. Out of places now. So not. Maybe I can start looking. Yeah. So. Kind of gave me a good time.  
Me: The planes might be out of repair. But.  
Them: Yeah. Yeah. So, Andrew, are you bay area? No, I'm actually based in Canada. Okay, that would make sense. Why you are from there Canada employee? Yeah. The first unplay in Canada. Yeah, Based in Toronto, so. Actually, I don't think that far from you. Kevin. Sure, sure. I'm Milwaukee, right? That's right. Yeah. Could come in handy on one of our developing deals right now. To have a Canadian employee. You guys are working on Ford, right? Yeah. Which. Which facility? Yeah, man, I defer to you. I don't. I don't know what. I don't know. I've been out of the loop on that. I get brought in when there's something technical. And we're not. We're still. We're still doing preliminary numbers and terms sheets and. Stuff like that. We haven't gone into technical diligence, but that's. That's when I would get involved. So actually, I don't know. I only know it by name at this point. What's the name? No, just four kids. I know nothing beyond approximate deal size. And that. It's a Ford facility in Canada. We'll see. That's it. Okay. I was just curious because I live near a Ford facility, live near Isha Fort slip. So I was wondering if it was that one. But anyways. Do you guys know? Are we waiting for Ben to join this call?  
Me: No, I think he's out. Is that correct, Andrew?  
Them: Yeah. I know he's got personal stuff, but he had called me just before this, and. Actually, I should have asked him if he was planning to join. I wasn't sure if he was calling me just to make sure that we're set to go with what we need and understand what his mission is here or. Yeah. So I'm pretty sure he's not planning to join and it's just us.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: The way that he described it was you guys would. You'd have your questions. Lucas, you understand what we're trying to achieve here?  
Me: That's right.  
Them: And Andrew, you've worked it through a similar process before, I think. And we're here as those with the metrics, experience and the contact list of previous hospitals and Personas that we've worked with, communicated with in the past. So not sure where we take it from here. I sent. Prior to this meeting, Kevin and I had gone through some of our old some closed opportunities. Closed one opportunities that we've had with hospitals. Looked at the contact lists and key contacts for those, and then I looked at a number of other hospital opportunities. And projects that we were in development on over the last few years, and I provided those key contacts. So not sure if that's sufficient or if you guys are looking for something different. Let us know. Yeah. What do you need?  
Me: That is very helpful. Yet I'm looking at the list that you sent over here. So Andrew and I had a phone call with Ben not that long ago. Andrew, I want to say it was two days ago. But maybe. And we were discussing specifically in the research workflow of figuring out who the right contacts are to try to find that sale.  
Them: Y.  
Me: So this list, Austin, that you sent over, these are all closed deals, is that correct?  
Them: No, these are not all closed deals. Only two of them are Kuikini Health and Bristol Hospital.  
Me: Okay, and then the others are at least the target buyer Persona. Like the person you're speaking with is potentially the buyer in the deal.  
Them: Most of these are going to be a buying committee with hospitals or health care systems, and you have to kind of buy for Kate, whether you're talking to an individual hospital or a healthcare system that manages a hospital. And then different organizations are going to treat their profit and loss differently. So some healthcare organizations will have a parent company that manages that, whereas others will have each hospital will be its own business entity with its own profit and loss. So that's one thing that makes the healthcare sector, or generally any sector, just challenging, is it's hard to know there's no hard and fast rule for who the buyer is going to be.  
Me: Could you. Oh, sorry. Really quick.  
Them: Most of. Yeah, go ahead.  
Me: And maybe you were just about to get here. I'm sure you could answer this question in a 50,000 word essay, but I'm kind of curious. If you could summarize for us. How it is that you even discover that contact? Right. We'll try to do is. We'll try to automate a little bit of that.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: But it does no good if we just pull up a long list of names and then you have to go and do the research and discovering who the contact is anyway. Right? So rather than do that, we'll try to, as much as possible, bake into some system. The way of starting with the target account and then getting to the qualifiers that make someone really likely to be a buyer.  
Them: Yeah. I mean, you guys know, I think you're pretty familiar with metric's go to market approach. Has been in the past. We were focused on direct sales. Past couple years has been very channel partner focused through our Esco Partners. And now we're starting back up direct sales focus that's much more intentional using more tools. In the past, we were using Zoom Info and their outreach type software to identify buyer Personas. It was pretty limited in that we can only put in, like, eight different buyer Personas types. For all of the industry verticals that we were selling into. And so we couldn't go just into, like, let's look across hospitals specifically and say at hospitals, these are your typical buyers. But in terms of the way that we identified buyers, then we were doing lots of cold outreach to sustainability. Director of facility or maintenance, Energy manager. And cfo. Type managers and procurement, which is. Sometimes you'll have a procurement director at a hospital, sometimes not. It was a numbers game. And most of the time, you'd get your foot in the door through sustainability. Because they're not necessarily running around putting out fires like a director facilities is. They have the time to think big picture, and their job is like, how do we steer the ship in a different, more sustainable direction? So they're often the ones with the most curiosity but the least influence in buying power. And they're a good foot in the door and a good champion, but they need to get you over to the director, facilities. And we would sometimes get a foot in the door with the director of facilities because they're the ones who are day in, day out dealing with deferred maintenance, high costs of break. Fix type maintenance. They're the ones who feel the most pain around infrastructure needs, and then they're also the ones who are going directly to the CFO and trying to sell them on we need this project. And they're competing with other needs for capital. And most of the time don't get it. And that's what makes them a great champion for energy as a service, because they could say, cfo, I need all this shit. I can't pay for it. We can do this off balance. Sheet zero capex thing.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: That's my, like, 20,000 word essay version of how we'd get our foot in the door in the past.  
Me: No, it's so helpful for me. I'm curious, then, if you were to set up the buyer Personas today. You'd probably have to run these in tandem. If it was direct sales and you were in charge, Austin, would it be you would target the sustainability folks, and then you would also target that energy manager and that cf? I mean, would you go after all of them simultaneously with the same direct sales approach? Or would you kind of isolate them and target them in a different way? Where you're saying, look, inability folks, maybe it's just about building a connection. And then for the director facility, maybe it's about brand awareness or something.  
Them: Yeah. Yep. No, totally. The messaging is going to be different for facilities director versus the sustainability Persona. And I know that outreach has been totally designed around being able to create custom sequences for different Personas. So that's perfect. It's going to be. You're going to be more using technical language with director of Facilities around deferred maintenance. With sustainability, it's going to be more focused around emissions. And energy use reduction and things like that. It's interesting, though, because I think what we really want to focus on now and from a technical solution standpoint has evolved a lot since when we were previously doing direct sales, where now we're much more interested in doing things like replacing central plants. And Lucas, I don't know how much technical background you have in the energy world, but there's just a ton of opportunity for much larger projects.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: And these are things that are. They're not necessarily like the sustainability director at Ex Hospital is. They're not the one who's going to be the decision maker. On the central plant replacement. That's a very technical, highly engineered solution. That needs opinions, not just probably from the director of facilities and engineering, but from independent engineers. And it's a much more complex sale and process.  
Me: And for that, I think we're starting, based off our conversation with Ben, just on healthcare. Which would mean the hospitals and.  
Them: Yes.  
Me: So do you think focusing in just on hospitals, for example, we've obviously got an interest in the number of beds. Right. Things like that at the hospital level. But on the Persona level, Do you already have a couple of titles and roles that you might be able to provide that then we can begin doing the work of figuring out how to research and how to qualify whether or not they're actually a good person to direct sale to.  
Them: Yeah. It's interesting. Ben's approach, it sounded like was. Let's look at different key contacts. From hospitals we worked with in the past. Let's pull up there. Let's use AI to pull up their LinkedIn profiles and look at their job responsibilities when they were at. Some of them may have moved on by now, but let's look at what they were doing when they were at that hospital. And then use those bullet points, their responsibilities, to do a search on all of our other targets and identify those people. Which is. Yeah. That's interesting. And I think it makes sense to me. I'm excited to see what it Lucas like and what it. What it yields. Sorry. I'm getting away from your original question, though. Which was? What buyers or Personas would we target?  
Me: Exactly. Yes. So that the titles. And if you were to make that bullet point list, that was the perfect person to contact and make a phone call to.  
Them: Yeah. Can I just add something? To what, Austin? Said, yeah, please. So I think, I think one of the challenges Ben is trying to solve with that issue is that when you have. So traditionally, I just had a list of Adderall job, but it's going to be basically similar. I just had, like, a text file with all the job titles in it. I dropped that into Zoom info, and then I would just scroll through the 300 results. Of names and click and pick, right? And the hard part about doing that is at a company like Dow Chemical, There's 300 procurement managers. Which one is the energy one? I don't know. So I would just email all of them, basically, and just see what happens. Right. But anyways, it's very inefficient, right? So I think Ben's trying to say, like, hey, if this AI thing can go and scrape their LinkedIn and see, does anyone actually mention energy or just even just to let us know, like, hey, this is a really good person. Because sustainability director. Okay, that's obvious. Or like energy engineer is pretty clear. But for some of these other people that are involved, that are important, Having some of that information and pulled up. Would be really helpful. I think that's why he was also saying, indeed, just trying to get some color to it. No, that's great. I would say. I mean, check out the list that I sent and look at those job titles. And we can kind of, you know, I don't know, if I could just rattle off the top of my head, like, what are the best buyer Personas that we need to work with? I would look back at those. I mean, it's definitely going to be. It depends on where you're coming at. The customer in their decision making process. Eventually it's going to be CEO coos and cfos. Before that, you're working with Director of Facilities or Director of Engineering and Maintenance. Personas, and often before that, to lead up to those conversations. It will be sustainability manager, energy manager, So.  
Me: Right. I get what you're saying. It's like you have to build the relationships and then engage in sort of a handoff within the company.  
Them: Yeah, but sometimes our first contact will be a cfo, but that's really only like. They've already got a project that they've developed with an engine, er. Some engineer vendor that they've been working with, and they don't know how they're going to finance it. Or it could be one of our partners introduces us directly to a cfo. For our direct outreach. I don't think we should be reaching out. Directly to CFOs. I don't know. It's like they're the least likely to click on a cold email. And say, okay, I'll take this meeting. They just simply don't have the time for it. Sustainability directors might. Or if you say the right thing, a director of facilities might if you can accurately identify what their pain points are. Or predict what your pain points are. My take is that the single most important role at this level is the Director of Facilities or Director of Maintenance or Engineering director. And I think that we get them convinced of the solution or the Metros offering, and then they take it internally to the cfo. And then the CFO and the facility engineer become our champions. When they need to sell it to their board. I think that this type of deal that we're going to go after, that being like multi million dollar central utility plant type work, doesn't have the energy savings profile that are typical or historical projects have had. So energy engineer, energy manager, director of sustainability, those roles are much less important for this offering and that's my opinion, but I would say director. Level of engineering, Maintenance. And engineering. I agree. Definitely. For central plant type projects. But, Andrew, I don't know if you've talked to Ben about this. Are you going to be fully focused on things like central plant or large cooling and heating projects? Or metrics. Bread and butter over the course of our history has been multi measure energy efficiency projects. More stuff that you would think of as low hanging fruit. With favorable paybacks and all of that. There's a lot less of that now because obviously a lot of places have done their LED lighting conversion, stuff like that. And we used to sell almost exclusively, like, we'll do your LED lighting, and that means we can also do a chiller. And it doesn't really work that way anymore, but, I mean, it does for some. But. I don't know. Have you talked about. What's. What's the project we're trying to sell? I think he wants to make a big run at this hospital idea. He wants to do those like cooling as a service. That's what his. His thing he wants to try, but I don't think he's against. Doing these other kind of ideas. Okay as well. A more traditional offerings. I mean, I think it's good to have a diversified pipeline, if you will. Yeah, yeah, yeah, right. I think it does help to have one cohesive message though, because we can't either have an efficiency based deal or a cooling and heating based deal. But they do have relatively different value propositions. In either scenario, we would be the financier. And it doesn't really matter. We'll finance whatever project the customer is interested in having us finance. But our messaging is different. If it's an efficiency based deal, it's like, well, we can finance this multimeasure project and it has this savings profile and that has environmental benefits. And also there's a negative cash flow. Your cash flow positive throughout the term of the agreement. Versus the cup, which is, you got a lot of broken stuff and it's going to cost a lot of money. You don't have any cash. And we can do an upgrade right now. You don't pay anything up front. It's all off balance sheet. And you pay for. There's some performance risk transfer and you pay for measured output of capacity, delivery, availability, efficiency. So they're similar in that to us? It doesn't matter. We'll finance either project. And how we measure and verify, it's a bit different. But the messaging to the customers a bit different. So I don't know. Anytime we go to a customer, we'd be open to efficiency or we'd be open to cooling and heating. But I think how we lead without reach is going to be different. It might be better to have one message going into it. And I guess my understanding from these conversations with Ben is it was going to be more large infrastructure cooling and heating, central utility plant type projects that don't have the energy savings profile that are typical deal would have had. It's challenging, though, when you're selling multiple different solutions. Trying to hit the message that's going to resonate. And get them to respond to your email.  
Me: In quarterback. Austin, you know it so well. I'm sure. And Andrew, you know this, right?  
Them: Pick up a phone call.  
Me: But the goal is to create a personalized opener. Right? Where Maybe that's what you did. For every email that you were trying to maximize the percent of a response on yourself. Hopefully we can handle that and sort of pipe the personalized opener into outreach I o so that it's just a field that happens near automatic. You approve the email to make sure it Lucas right. But there's no need to do any of that research on what school someone went to or, you know, what their past job was. What they said their hobby is that the things that you might be able to hit on really briefly that help with that initial contact.  
Them: Yeah. I think it's because we're obviously a smaller team, so I think Ben wants to basically try to have a customization at scale. Right. And still do the same volume. Because to be honest, we used to do a lot of spray and pray. Which is not good. Right. But when you don't have good tools and you have high targets, you do these kind of solutions. But I think you're offering kind of lets us do have our cake and need it to. Get a lot of volume out, hit all the right contacts we want to hit, and have it be personalized and interesting for every single person that opens it. So I'm looking forward to seeing how that comes to life. And they agree with you, Kevin and Oslo. It's going to be an interesting way how we phrase. The actual body of the email to kind of hit both a little bit, like, talk maybe about the centricity plan as the main part, but also be like, hey, we also do this other stuff. So Ben and I will sit down with you guys, and I'm sure we'll craft some messaging that kind of focuses on that, but also leaves that are open to other stuff, too. So we're not pigeonholing ourselves as, like, oh, this thing when we can do other stuff. Yeah, I guess it does change who our target audience would be, though. Like, if we're leading with efficiency based deals, we might go after sustainability, folks. And if we're leading with central utility plants, we might go after facility maintenancers that have a desperate need for addressing deferred maintenance on a large scale. But, yeah, I think part of it comes down to what. 's What's the primary objective? Yeah. And I think the Austin point, we can do role based pretty easily do like role based targeting. So that's a good point. Maybe that's how we approach it, right? Yeah, totally. Dividends and then rebievil. Sure. That's a good point to bring up, though, what each group kind of cares about.  
Me: If on my.  
Them: That's a good point. Two different messages. There's environment. Anyone with environmental or sustainability in their title. Really focus on the part of our offering that results in energy savings, utility cost savings, greenhouse gas for reduction, things like that. If we go after CFO or financial or facility engineers, it's much more related to the deferred maintenance. Cup infrastructure.  
Me: If on my end I was going to focus in on a few of those. What's a number? Which would be sane, right? Because obviously an outreach I. O for every Persona, then you have to have your own set of messages and a B tests and crap. Do you all want to have 10 of these different buyer groups that you're targeting, or is it more reasonable to have two or three? For the purposes of this discussion,  
Them: Is there a limit in outreach? Do you know? Sequences as you want. Right. But. Well, I guess, yeah.  
Me: Do we have quantity limit, Andrew?  
Them: But it's like thousands a day or something. Yeah, I'm not worried about that. I'm just thinking the way that the Persona search works. At zoom on zoom info software. It was you would input your preferred Personas. For sonai, whatever the plural is. And then clicked on a company. And ask it to build a buying committee using those Persona. And it would give you a short list of the people that it thought fit. And what we're trying to do is go deeper and use our own AI to build those lists out. Then we'll import those lists into outreach and hit them with our custom messaging. Is that right? I think so, yeah. In a nutshell.  
Me: And even if you know already that there are good potential Persona, like if you have a target on an account already. You might be able to go and do the research for that target. Automatically.  
Them: Right. You don't need to go crazy. Like, for example, where we are now, I have basically three main sequences. I use one for procurement people that talks about cost savings. One for sustainability. People that talk to one of our mental stuff. And then one for like ehs and facilities people that talks more about doing stuff on your site. Right? It doesn't have to be, like, 25 different ways of doing it. No, I would say maybe. Between three to six, depending on the hospital. Whether you're talking about a hospital or a hospital system, different type of sequences available. But that doesn't mean every account we're using all of those different sequences. You'd look at who is yielded and your results as the buying committee for that account. And then decide which sequences do I want to put them on. The Director of Facilities and Engineering versus Sustainability versus Energy Manager. Procurement and then something for a financial Persona. And I think that might be. There might be one or two more different Personas. Well, I don't know. We're not going to be reaching out to Chief. CEO's, but controllers and finance people maybe doesn't yield very good open rates. Director or vp of facilities. Engineering or maintenance. I don't. I don't know. One thing we haven't done so much is outreach to people who are responsible for compliance and auditing. Facility auditing through. Joint Commission, or dnd. Those are the two main auditing bodies in the US for hospitals that monitor everything in terms of hospital quality. But a few of the important things are like their air quality, environmental conditions, and all of that. I don't think we've reached out to.  
Me: That almost sounds like. That almost sounds like a partnership distribution model. No.  
Them: I don't know what that is, so I'm not sure. But.  
Me: Sorry. I'm using, like, business slang to describe what might be just another channel, which, if you built a relationship with that company, then maybe they send some leave.  
Them: Yeah. No. The full relationship between Joint Commission and hospitals. I don't think it would be another channel, but one of the things Ben brought up was like, who's in charge of compliance at the hospital, and are they experiencing pain points as a result of their infrastructure?  
Me: Okay?  
Them: There might be a Persona for us to look into there. But yeah, facilities and manage and maintenance. Maybe finance, sustainability, energy.  
Me: Excellent.  
Them: Those are ins. Yeah. Awesome. Share point. I think that's really interesting. I was just searching up while you were talking who that person would be. And they recommended the chief medical officer or anybody like clinical leadership. So they'd be operating officer. Yeah, Those type of roles. Yeah. They're worried about how the inventor is affecting patients. Care, quality, whatever. Yeah.  
Me: Okay? I'm aware that we're at time, and I feel like. By the way, I've got a ton of notes here on my side. For how we could do this, but is there anything else missing?  
Them: Okay? I don't know because I don't know how you're going to do this is pretty cool, but excited to see you at this yield.  
Me: It's an open ended question.  
Them: Yeah. Yeah. No, I don't think so. I think this is a good conversation around, like. Yeah. But the types of Personas and messaging we should pursue, obviously, the messaging will be the next step, and we'll refine that and what those sequences look like. And you know, Andrew, that'll. That'll be your domain. But I'm happy to chip in on that because I've done a lot of. I've written way too many sequences in the past. So some lessons learned, I guess.  
Me: Sweet.  
Them: Yeah. No, this is good.  
Me: I'll be sure to send you all notes. That way none of this effort is wasted. If you want to re jog of memory on this, at some point, we'll have it.  
Them: Can I ask a question? Did you write down notes or did you use AI to take notes?  
Me: The answer to that is both. Always both. The brain sometimes works better than just asking. AI, summarize this, right? It doesn't really know what's good.  
Them: Okay, good. All right. Yeah. Nice. All right. Cool. Thanks, guys. Yeah.  
Me: You guys.  
Them: Nice to meet you guys and looking forward to working together soon.  
Me: Me too.  
Them: Lucas Great. Yeah. Thank you both.  
Me: Enjoy the weekend.  
Them: Yeah, we'll do the real welcome soon. All right, See you guys. Bye.
