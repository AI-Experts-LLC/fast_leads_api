Darren supported equipment repairs, tracking/metrics, and the injury prevention program.

Brian brings multiple skills to the table and is able to manage complex multiphase projects with various contracting styles (IPD, GMP, Lump Sum, Lean IPD, Design/Build ). Brian also effectively managed and maintained the project budget, he communicated all potential issues to the team and kept everyone actively engaged in creative problem solving. If our healthcare system ever looked to build any large design build campus I would request we engage Brian and his team as their skill set has proven to be second to none."

Achieving the highest levels of performance starts with design of products and systems, integrating the contributions of a complex network of suppliers, and coordinating production according to key constraints throughout the supply chain. Finally, the most effective route to achieving continuous improvement in this environment is the integrated application of Lean, Six Sigma, and Theory of Constraints."

Darren supported equipment repairs, tracking/metrics, and the injury prevention program. Darren could be seen fostering connections throughout the day with patients and caregivers on a personal level and he genuinely cares for those around him.

Brian brings multiple skills to the table and is able to manage complex multiphase projects with various contracting styles (IPD, GMP, Lump Sum, Lean IPD, Design/Build ). Brian also effectively managed and maintained the project budget, he communicated all potential issues to the team and kept everyone actively engaged in creative problem solving. If our healthcare system ever looked to build any large design build campus I would request we engage Brian and his team as their skill set has proven to be second to none."

His background includes functioning as a CFO of individual hospitals and working at the corporate level.  This broad experience gives Paul the ability to perform analytics from the needs of the smallest facility as well as from a regional and corporate perspective. I highly recommend Paul and would be happy to discuss in more detail his performance while working with me.  I can be reached at hcoble@gmail.com or on my cell at 770-367-6840.  Hal Coble "

Towards the end of my time working with Tricia and her team, we had a surprise thank-you party for the team to notice and appreciate their contribution to our success, and turnout from our leadership and staff further demonstrated what Tricia's importance was to our operational and technical goals.

The turnaround and reconciliation work he performed in a hospital that had no financial reporting or accounting performed for over six months, was incredible.  He efficiently and professionally handled an extremely difficult financial challenge.  His work ethic is second to none.  Paul is an individual of high ethical integrity and morals.  His background includes functioning as a CFO of individual hospitals and working at the corporate level.  This broad experience gives Paul the ability to perform analytics from the needs of the smallest facility as well as from a regional and corporate perspective. I highly recommend Paul and would be happy to discuss in more detail his performance while working with me.  I can be reached at hcoble@gmail.com or on my cell at 770-367-6840.  Hal Coble "

Tricia took an innovative approach to troubleshooting the device, network, and application issues, and was exceptional in her consistent solutions, follow through, and seeing our projects to completion.  Regardless of whether she was working with the C-Suite or a small off-campus location, she was persistent in seeking a solution.  Towards the end of my time working with Tricia and her team, we had a surprise thank-you party for the team to notice and appreciate their contribution to our success, and turnout from our leadership and staff further demonstrated what Tricia's importance was to our operational and technical goals.  I'm very pleased to recommend Tricia as a positive for any IT team!"

Darren supported equipment repairs, tracking/metrics, and the injury prevention program.

Brian brings multiple skills to the table and is able to manage complex multiphase projects with various contracting styles (IPD, GMP, Lump Sum, Lean IPD, Design/Build ). Brian also effectively managed and maintained the project budget, he communicated all potential issues to the team and kept everyone actively engaged in creative problem solving. If our healthcare system ever looked to build any large design build campus I would request we engage Brian and his team as their skill set has proven to be second to none."

While many courses in manufacturing focus on the mechanical operations and processes, this certificate focuses on maximizing the performance of the entire system. Achieving the highest levels of performance starts with design of products and systems, integrating the contributions of a complex network of suppliers, and coordinating production according to key constraints throughout the supply chain. Finally, the most effective route to achieving continuous improvement in this environment is the integrated application of Lean, Six Sigma, and Theory of Constraints."

He does his research on the topic at hand and comes to the table well educated and ready to offer solutions to whatever issue may arise.  He has an extensive background in acute care hospital construction and understands clinical needs that impact design and construction.  Cylix is dedicated to the best outcome for all parties and is great to work with, a high performer in all environments."

He led our group through some difficult decisions and always put the patients and employee safety first. We saw situations where caregivers were being injured during patient lifting scenarios. Darren supported equipment repairs, tracking/metrics, and the injury prevention program. Darren could be seen fostering connections throughout the day with patients and caregivers on a personal level and he genuinely cares for those around him.  He has strong core values and leadership skills that are exemplary. I highly recommend Darren, he is a highly motivated, action-oriented, results driven leader."

Brian worked with us on several large initiatives including a large Teaching-Health Clinic and a ground-up 100 bed inpatient behavioral health hospital. Brian brings multiple skills to the table and is able to manage complex multiphase projects with various contracting styles (IPD, GMP, Lump Sum, Lean IPD, Design/Build ). Brian also effectively managed and maintained the project budget, he communicated all potential issues to the team and kept everyone actively engaged in creative problem solving. If our healthcare system ever looked to build any large design build campus I would request we engage Brian and his team as their skill set has proven to be second to none."

The turnaround and reconciliation work he performed in a hospital that had no financial reporting or accounting performed for over six months, was incredible.  He efficiently and professionally handled an extremely difficult financial challenge.  His work ethic is second to none.  Paul is an individual of high ethical integrity and morals.  His background includes functioning as a CFO of individual hospitals and working at the corporate level.  This broad experience gives Paul the ability to perform analytics from the needs of the smallest facility as well as from a regional and corporate perspective. I highly recommend Paul and would be happy to discuss in more detail his performance while working with me.  I can be reached at hcoble@gmail.com or on my cell at 770-367-6840.  Hal Coble "

Regardless of whether she was working with the C-Suite or a small off-campus location, she was persistent in seeking a solution.  Towards the end of my time working with Tricia and her team, we had a surprise thank-you party for the team to notice and appreciate their contribution to our success, and turnout from our leadership and staff further demonstrated what Tricia's importance was to our operational and technical goals.

The turnaround and reconciliation work he performed in a hospital that had no financial reporting or accounting performed for over six months, was incredible.  He efficiently and professionally handled an extremely difficult financial challenge.  His work ethic is second to none.  Paul is an individual of high ethical integrity and morals.  His background includes functioning as a CFO of individual hospitals and working at the corporate level.  This broad experience gives Paul the ability to perform analytics from the needs of the smallest facility as well as from a regional and corporate perspective. I highly recommend Paul and would be happy to discuss in more detail his performance while working with me.  I can be reached at hcoble@gmail.com or on my cell at 770-367-6840.  Hal Coble "

Regardless of whether she was working with the C-Suite or a small off-campus location, she was persistent in seeking a solution.  Towards the end of my time working with Tricia and her team, we had a surprise thank-you party for the team to notice and appreciate their contribution to our success, and turnout from our leadership and staff further demonstrated what Tricia's importance was to our operational and technical goals.  I'm very pleased to recommend Tricia as a positive for any IT team!"

There are always skills to acquire, facts to learn, and character traits to further develop. I take great pride in my commitment to pushing myself beyond my previous limits. This constant pushing has led to trust and praise everywhere I have been. I easily win the respect of my peers and supervisors through my unyielding work ethic, independence, and calm, reliable nature.\n\nCliftonStrengths: Adaptability, Empathy, Restorative, Intellection, Connectedness",

There were several tasks we requested of him and his team which included validation of hardware deployment and configuration and testing of all workstations. During the main event for testing Johnny and his team Johnny and his team did a great job working around patient care and caregivers as this was a production environment in an active hospital. His demeanor with peers and colleagues was exemplary and if we had an opening on our team, I am confident we would have gladly recruited him to work for us.

In his role as an IS Project Manager he was responsible to attend and report out progress and barriers daily, communicate directly with the clinical caregivers when scheduling and entering their workspace. The clinical environment takes compassion and empathy; both of which Alvin displays. \n\nOther key skills would be his ability to develop relationships and trust with the key stakeholders and team members.

There were several tasks we requested of him and his team which included validation of hardware deployment and configuration and testing of all workstations. During the main event for testing Johnny and his team Johnny and his team did a great job working around patient care and caregivers as this was a production environment in an active hospital. His demeanor with peers and colleagues was exemplary and if we had an opening on our team, I am confident we would have gladly recruited him to work for us. His clinical experience and understanding of technology is very helpful when bridging the gap for customers."

My direct reports interacted with Alvin daily and I served as an escalation point for the holistic project.\n\nAlvin is professional, accountable, and possesses a passion for the details and customer satisfaction. In his role as an IS Project Manager he was responsible to attend and report out progress and barriers daily, communicate directly with the clinical caregivers when scheduling and entering their workspace. The clinical environment takes compassion and empathy; both of which Alvin displays. \n\nOther key skills would be his ability to develop relationships and trust with the key stakeholders and team members. This was accomplished by being accountable, knowledgeable, flexible, and approachable. Any organization would be lucky to have him."

            "about": "I am an IT professional with 20 years of experience in the Enterprise IT environment. Specializing in end to end customer support for IT systems and applications. My broad IT background has allowed me to experience many different types of IT services from Tier 1 Call centers to Managing large Healthcare IT environments across multiple sites.  As a manager of IT operations for multiple healthcare sites I still like to get my hands dirty helping others with their IT related questions or needs. I am an avid computer user outside of work and love streaming, Gaming E-Sports, pop culture and 3-D printing.  \n\nThe last 3 years my role has evolved in to one of transformation as we transform the IT environment into a highly reliable, sustainable and compliant Enterprise IT vision.  Moving from IT Admin to IT Supervisor and now an IT manager of multiple Enterprise Healthcare locations.  I am excited to see what the future of computing will bring to the table.",

These interactive wellness workshops consisted of approximately 10-20 participants and allowed individuals to be directly involved in their wellness goals through awareness and health education. \n\nAssisted in the development of processes and procedures which were required for NCQM accreditation for wellness programs. This consisted of structured and detailed documentation of the implementation and administration of our wellness. \n\nDeveloped a proposal for implementing a wellness initiative within the Native American community in San Diego, focusing on culture, beliefs, and values. Conducted research and used best practices to develop a culturally appropriate program, providing community members an opportunity to improve their health while remaining sensitive to their culture and beliefs."

In his role as an IS Project Manager he was responsible to attend and report out progress and barriers daily, communicate directly with the clinical caregivers when scheduling and entering their workspace. The clinical environment takes compassion and empathy; both of which Alvin displays. \n\nOther key skills would be his ability to develop relationships and trust with the key stakeholders and team members.

Once Epic was fully deployed and had gone live at the hospital work transitioned to managing other projects that included equipping and preparing several new clinics and departments with technology and the Epic EMR. Eventually the experience gained was deemed valuable and was requested to travel and train other Providence desktop teams for deployments of Epic in Walla Walla and Spokane.

There were several tasks we requested of him and his team which included validation of hardware deployment and configuration and testing of all workstations. During the main event for testing Johnny and his team Johnny and his team did a great job working around patient care and caregivers as this was a production environment in an active hospital. His demeanor with peers and colleagues was exemplary and if we had an opening on our team, I am confident we would have gladly recruited him to work for us. His clinical experience and understanding of technology is very helpful when bridging the gap for customers."

During the time we worked together my role was a Principal Project Manager and later a Senior Manager of a team that was heavily involved with the implementation of the Epic electronic medical record for Covenant Health in Texas and New Mexico. My direct reports interacted with Alvin daily and I served as an escalation point for the holistic project.\n\nAlvin is professional, accountable, and possesses a passion for the details and customer satisfaction. In his role as an IS Project Manager he was responsible to attend and report out progress and barriers daily, communicate directly with the clinical caregivers when scheduling and entering their workspace. The clinical environment takes compassion and empathy; both of which Alvin displays. \n\nOther key skills would be his ability to develop relationships and trust with the key stakeholders and team members. This was accomplished by being accountable, knowledgeable, flexible, and approachable. Any organization would be lucky to have him."

He efficiently and professionally handled an extremely difficult financial challenge.  His work ethic is second to none.  Paul is an individual of high ethical integrity and morals.  His background includes functioning as a CFO of individual hospitals and working at the corporate level.  This broad experience gives Paul the ability to perform analytics from the needs of the smallest facility as well as from a regional and corporate perspective. I highly recommend Paul and would be happy to discuss in more detail his performance while working with me.  I can be reached at hcoble@gmail.com or on my cell at 770-367-6840.  Hal Coble "

Regardless of whether she was working with the C-Suite or a small off-campus location, she was persistent in seeking a solution.  Towards the end of my time working with Tricia and her team, we had a surprise thank-you party for the team to notice and appreciate their contribution to our success, and turnout from our leadership and staff further demonstrated what Tricia's importance was to our operational and technical goals.

The turnaround and reconciliation work he performed in a hospital that had no financial reporting or accounting performed for over six months, was incredible.  He efficiently and professionally handled an extremely difficult financial challenge.  His work ethic is second to none.  Paul is an individual of high ethical integrity and morals.  His background includes functioning as a CFO of individual hospitals and working at the corporate level.  This broad experience gives Paul the ability to perform analytics from the needs of the smallest facility as well as from a regional and corporate perspective. I highly recommend Paul and would be happy to discuss in more detail his performance while working with me.  I can be reached at hcoble@gmail.com or on my cell at 770-367-6840.  Hal Coble "

Regardless of whether she was working with the C-Suite or a small off-campus location, she was persistent in seeking a solution.  Towards the end of my time working with Tricia and her team, we had a surprise thank-you party for the team to notice and appreciate their contribution to our success, and turnout from our leadership and staff further demonstrated what Tricia's importance was to our operational and technical goals.

            "about": "I am an IT professional with 20 years of experience in the Enterprise IT environment. Specializing in end to end customer support for IT systems and applications. My broad IT background has allowed me to experience many different types of IT services from Tier 1 Call centers to Managing large Healthcare IT environments across multiple sites.  As a manager of IT operations for multiple healthcare sites I still like to get my hands dirty helping others with their IT related questions or needs. I am an avid computer user outside of work and love streaming, Gaming E-Sports, pop culture and 3-D printing.  \n\nThe last 3 years my role has evolved in to one of transformation as we transform the IT environment into a highly reliable, sustainable and compliant Enterprise IT vision.  Moving from IT Admin to IT Supervisor and now an IT manager of multiple Enterprise Healthcare locations.  I am excited to see what the future of computing will bring to the table.",

My goal is to spread as widely as possible the basis for my great relationships, namely humor, self-awareness, and trust.\n\nI believe everything in life can be improved, that there is no maximum to what can be accomplished. There are always skills to acquire, facts to learn, and character traits to further develop. I take great pride in my commitment to pushing myself beyond my previous limits. This constant pushing has led to trust and praise everywhere I have been. I easily win the respect of my peers and supervisors through my unyielding work ethic, independence, and calm, reliable nature.\n\nCliftonStrengths: Adaptability, Empathy, Restorative, Intellection, Connectedness",

While many courses in manufacturing focus on the mechanical operations and processes, this certificate focuses on maximizing the performance of the entire system. Achieving the highest levels of performance starts with design of products and systems, integrating the contributions of a complex network of suppliers, and coordinating production according to key constraints throughout the supply chain. Finally, the most effective route to achieving continuous improvement in this environment is the integrated application of Lean, Six Sigma, and Theory of Constraints."

Brian brings multiple skills to the table and is able to manage complex multiphase projects with various contracting styles (IPD, GMP, Lump Sum, Lean IPD, Design/Build ). Brian also effectively managed and maintained the project budget, he communicated all potential issues to the team and kept everyone actively engaged in creative problem solving.

While many courses in manufacturing focus on the mechanical operations and processes, this certificate focuses on maximizing the performance of the entire system. Achieving the highest levels of performance starts with design of products and systems, integrating the contributions of a complex network of suppliers, and coordinating production according to key constraints throughout the supply chain. Finally, the most effective route to achieving continuous improvement in this environment is the integrated application of Lean, Six Sigma, and Theory of Constraints."

He has an extensive background in acute care hospital construction and understands clinical needs that impact design and construction.

He led our group through some difficult decisions and always put the patients and employee safety first. We saw situations where caregivers were being injured during patient lifting scenarios. Darren supported equipment repairs, tracking/metrics, and the injury prevention program. Darren could be seen fostering connections throughout the day with patients and caregivers on a personal level and he genuinely cares for those around him.  He has strong core values and leadership skills that are exemplary. I highly recommend Darren, he is a highly motivated, action-oriented, results driven leader."

Brian worked with us on several large initiatives including a large Teaching-Health Clinic and a ground-up 100 bed inpatient behavioral health hospital. Brian brings multiple skills to the table and is able to manage complex multiphase projects with various contracting styles (IPD, GMP, Lump Sum, Lean IPD, Design/Build ). Brian also effectively managed and maintained the project budget, he communicated all potential issues to the team and kept everyone actively engaged in creative problem solving. If our healthcare system ever looked to build any large design build campus I would request we engage Brian and his team as their skill set has proven to be second to none."

I have had experience in writing bylaws, articles of incorporation, and researching non-profit laws and regulations. Beyond the paperwork and legal aspects, have gained an immense amount of knowledge in project management, fundraising events, and shipping.\n\nI served as the project coordinator for our first large shipment to Tanzania, where I gained valuable experience in communicating with our partners overseas, as well as coordinating with multiple parties to ensure a seamless process in shipping and collecting the donated goods. I also served on the event planning committee. Our success in reaching out to local companies and hosting fundraising events allowed us to raise the funds necessary to send our first package to Tanzania.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/#!/sharecycle\nhttp://www.facebook.com/sharecycle"
