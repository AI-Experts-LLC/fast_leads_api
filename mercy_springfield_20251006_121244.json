The clinical department had undergone significant change and turnover prior to my arrival, and it was critical for the two of us to continue building relationships with our respective teams and get buy in to a coherent vision to achieve excellent outcomes and care. We set out to work on a number of goals simultaneously that were not only important to our department but the hospital and community as well. These included streamlining clinical processes, onboarding of new providers, team-building, creating and implementing computerized order sets, minimizing disruptive behavior and creating a safe patient environment. I enjoyed working with Manish on these varied and challenging goals, and found him to be diligent and adept at navigating the department in a difficult environment. He was not only a strong patient advocate, but supported nursing initiatives whenever appropriate.   Kelly Chevalier, BSN, RN, CEN"

The clinical department had undergone significant change and turnover prior to my arrival, and it was critical for the two of us to continue building relationships with our respective teams and get buy in to a coherent vision to achieve excellent outcomes and care. We set out to work on a number of goals simultaneously that were not only important to our department but the hospital and community as well. These included streamlining clinical processes, onboarding of new providers, team-building, creating and implementing computerized order sets, minimizing disruptive behavior and creating a safe patient environment. I enjoyed working with Manish on these varied and challenging goals, and found him to be diligent and adept at navigating the department in a difficult environment. He was not only a strong patient advocate, but supported nursing initiatives whenever appropriate.   Kelly Chevalier, BSN, RN, CEN"

These patients are at high risk for complications, many of which necessitate emergency care. While rehospitalization rates have been described, there is little data regarding emergency department (ED) visits. We hypothesize that ED visits are frequent and often require admission after LVAD implantation. We performed a retrospective review of patients in our health-care system followed by the advanced heart failure service for LVAD management after implantation between January 2011 and July 2015. We accounted for all ED visits in our system through February 2016, 7 months after the last implantation included. Clinically relevant demographic variables and ED visit details were recorded and analyzed to describe this population. We identified 81 patients with complete data, among whom there were 283 visits (3.49 visits/patient), occurring at a rate of approximately 7.3 ED visits per patient per year alive with LVAD. The most common reason for an ED visit is a complication related to bleeding (18% of visits), followed by chest pain (14%) and dizziness or syncope (13%). Thirty-six percent of patients were discharged from the ED without hospital admission. A growing populace with implanted LVADs represents an important population within emergency medicine. They are at risk for significant complications and frequently present to the ED. While many of these visits may be managed without hospital admission, this specialized patient group represents a potential area for improvement in provider education."

One such high-risk ECG pattern includes the association of the prominent T wave and J-point depression producing ST-segment depression seen in the precordial leads coupled with ST-segment elevation in lead aVr. This ECG presentation is associated with significant left anterior descending artery obstruction. We report the case of a patient with this ECG presentation who progressed over a very short time to ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction of the anterior wall."

These patients are at high risk for complications, many of which necessitate emergency care. While rehospitalization rates have been described, there is little data regarding emergency department (ED) visits. We hypothesize that ED visits are frequent and often require admission after LVAD implantation. We performed a retrospective review of patients in our health-care system followed by the advanced heart failure service for LVAD management after implantation between January 2011 and July 2015. We accounted for all ED visits in our system through February 2016, 7 months after the last implantation included. Clinically relevant demographic variables and ED visit details were recorded and analyzed to describe this population. We identified 81 patients with complete data, among whom there were 283 visits (3.49 visits/patient), occurring at a rate of approximately 7.3 ED visits per patient per year alive with LVAD. The most common reason for an ED visit is a complication related to bleeding (18% of visits), followed by chest pain (14%) and dizziness or syncope (13%). Thirty-six percent of patients were discharged from the ED without hospital admission. A growing populace with implanted LVADs represents an important population within emergency medicine. They are at risk for significant complications and frequently present to the ED. While many of these visits may be managed without hospital admission, this specialized patient group represents a potential area for improvement in provider education."

One such high-risk ECG pattern includes the association of the prominent T wave and J-point depression producing ST-segment depression seen in the precordial leads coupled with ST-segment elevation in lead aVr. This ECG presentation is associated with significant left anterior descending artery obstruction. We report the case of a patient with this ECG presentation who progressed over a very short time to ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction of the anterior wall."

The clinical department had undergone significant change and turnover prior to my arrival, and it was critical for the two of us to continue building relationships with our respective teams and get buy in to a coherent vision to achieve excellent outcomes and care. We set out to work on a number of goals simultaneously that were not only important to our department but the hospital and community as well. These included streamlining clinical processes, onboarding of new providers, team-building, creating and implementing computerized order sets, minimizing disruptive behavior and creating a safe patient environment. I enjoyed working with Manish on these varied and challenging goals, and found him to be diligent and adept at navigating the department in a difficult environment. He was not only a strong patient advocate, but supported nursing initiatives whenever appropriate.   Kelly Chevalier, BSN, RN, CEN"

The clinical department had undergone significant change and turnover prior to my arrival, and it was critical for the two of us to continue building relationships with our respective teams and get buy in to a coherent vision to achieve excellent outcomes and care. We set out to work on a number of goals simultaneously that were not only important to our department but the hospital and community as well. These included streamlining clinical processes, onboarding of new providers, team-building, creating and implementing computerized order sets, minimizing disruptive behavior and creating a safe patient environment. I enjoyed working with Manish on these varied and challenging goals, and found him to be diligent and adept at navigating the department in a difficult environment. He was not only a strong patient advocate, but supported nursing initiatives whenever appropriate.   Kelly Chevalier, BSN, RN, CEN"

These patients are at high risk for complications, many of which necessitate emergency care. While rehospitalization rates have been described, there is little data regarding emergency department (ED) visits. We hypothesize that ED visits are frequent and often require admission after LVAD implantation. We performed a retrospective review of patients in our health-care system followed by the advanced heart failure service for LVAD management after implantation between January 2011 and July 2015. We accounted for all ED visits in our system through February 2016, 7 months after the last implantation included. Clinically relevant demographic variables and ED visit details were recorded and analyzed to describe this population. We identified 81 patients with complete data, among whom there were 283 visits (3.49 visits/patient), occurring at a rate of approximately 7.3 ED visits per patient per year alive with LVAD. The most common reason for an ED visit is a complication related to bleeding (18% of visits), followed by chest pain (14%) and dizziness or syncope (13%). Thirty-six percent of patients were discharged from the ED without hospital admission. A growing populace with implanted LVADs represents an important population within emergency medicine. They are at risk for significant complications and frequently present to the ED. While many of these visits may be managed without hospital admission, this specialized patient group represents a potential area for improvement in provider education."

One such high-risk ECG pattern includes the association of the prominent T wave and J-point depression producing ST-segment depression seen in the precordial leads coupled with ST-segment elevation in lead aVr. This ECG presentation is associated with significant left anterior descending artery obstruction. We report the case of a patient with this ECG presentation who progressed over a very short time to ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction of the anterior wall."

These patients are at high risk for complications, many of which necessitate emergency care. While rehospitalization rates have been described, there is little data regarding emergency department (ED) visits. We hypothesize that ED visits are frequent and often require admission after LVAD implantation. We performed a retrospective review of patients in our health-care system followed by the advanced heart failure service for LVAD management after implantation between January 2011 and July 2015. We accounted for all ED visits in our system through February 2016, 7 months after the last implantation included. Clinically relevant demographic variables and ED visit details were recorded and analyzed to describe this population. We identified 81 patients with complete data, among whom there were 283 visits (3.49 visits/patient), occurring at a rate of approximately 7.3 ED visits per patient per year alive with LVAD. The most common reason for an ED visit is a complication related to bleeding (18% of visits), followed by chest pain (14%) and dizziness or syncope (13%). Thirty-six percent of patients were discharged from the ED without hospital admission. A growing populace with implanted LVADs represents an important population within emergency medicine. They are at risk for significant complications and frequently present to the ED. While many of these visits may be managed without hospital admission, this specialized patient group represents a potential area for improvement in provider education."

One such high-risk ECG pattern includes the association of the prominent T wave and J-point depression producing ST-segment depression seen in the precordial leads coupled with ST-segment elevation in lead aVr. This ECG presentation is associated with significant left anterior descending artery obstruction. We report the case of a patient with this ECG presentation who progressed over a very short time to ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction of the anterior wall."
