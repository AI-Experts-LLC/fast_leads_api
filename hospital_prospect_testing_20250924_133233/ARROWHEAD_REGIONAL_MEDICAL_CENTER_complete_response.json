He had great insight into managing the registration process, and course planning. He was present at our planning meetings, and managed our off site registration, and was very easy to work with and contact. His customer service was outstanding. We will be using Pierre and his team again in 2016\" Thanks and I look forward to working with you again.\" \r\n -Eric Arnott\r\n+Event Planner \r\n"
