# AI Ranking Status Report

**Date:** October 8, 2025
**Issue:** AI ranking calls are failing, system falling back to seniority scores

---

## Current Situation

### ‚ùå Problem: AI Ranking Not Working

**Test Results (Providence Medford):**
- After Advanced Filter: 36 prospects
- Successfully AI Ranked: 0
- Using Fallback Ranking: 8
- AI Ranking Failure Rate: **100%**

### What's Happening

All prospects shown as "qualified" are actually using **fallback seniority scores**, not real AI rankings:

```
Paul Ziegele - 100/100 - "Fallback ranking based on seniority score (100)"
Ryan Hutchinson - 77/100 - "Fallback ranking based on seniority score (77)"
```

### Root Cause

**GPT-5 is not available in the OpenAI API yet.**

When we configured the service to use `gpt-5`, the API calls failed because:
1. GPT-5 doesn't exist in the API
2. GPT-5-specific parameters (`reasoning_effort`, `verbosity`, `max_output_tokens`) are not supported
3. All API calls fail silently, triggering fallback ranking

---

## What We Tried

###  Attempted Fix #1: Use GPT-5
**Changed:** Model from `gpt-4o-mini` ‚Üí `gpt-5`
**Result:** ‚ùå API calls fail (model doesn't exist)

### Attempted Fix #2: Use GPT-4o
**Changed:** Model from `gpt-5` ‚Üí `gpt-4o`
**Result:** ‚ùå Still failing (code may have other issues)

### ‚úÖ What IS Working

1. **Search** - Finding 242 prospects
2. **Basic Filter** - Removing 33 low-quality prospects
3. **LinkedIn Scraping** - Getting 146 profiles
4. **Advanced Filter** - Filtering to 36 high-potential prospects
5. **Fallback Ranking** - Seniority-based scoring working
6. **Simplified Prompt** - New prompt is loaded and ready

### ‚ùå What Is NOT Working

1. **AI Ranking API Calls** - 100% failure rate
2. **Error Logging** - Not seeing detailed errors in logs
3. **GPT-5 Integration** - Model not available yet

---

## Current Configuration

**Model:** `gpt-4o` (fallback from gpt-5)
**Prompt:** v3.0 Simplified (‚úÖ loaded correctly)
**Status:** AI ranking failing, using seniority fallback

---

## Next Steps to Fix

### Option 1: Debug OpenAI API Calls ‚≠ê RECOMMENDED

**Action:** Add detailed logging to see why gpt-4o calls are failing

```python
# In improved_ai_ranking.py
try:
    response = self.client.chat.completions.create(**api_params)
    logger.info(f"‚úÖ Prospect {index} ranked successfully")
except Exception as e:
    logger.error(f"‚ùå Prospect {index} API call failed")
    logger.error(f"   Model: {self.model}")
    logger.error(f"   Error: {type(e).__name__}: {str(e)}")
    logger.error(f"   Params: {api_params}")
```

**Expected Outcome:** See actual error messages to identify the issue

---

### Option 2: Test with Known Working Model

**Action:** Temporarily use `gpt-4o-mini` (known to work)

```python
self.model = os.getenv('OPENAI_MODEL', 'gpt-4o-mini')
```

**Expected Outcome:** If this works, confirms gpt-4o has an issue

---

### Option 3: Check OpenAI API Key

**Action:** Verify API key has access to gpt-4o

```bash
# Test API key with simple request
curl https://api.openai.com/v1/models \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $OPENAI_API_KEY"
```

**Expected Outcome:** List available models to confirm gpt-4o access

---

## Comparison: Old vs New

### With Old System (gpt-4o-mini, complex rubric)
```
After Advanced Filter: 32
Successfully AI Ranked: 0 (0%)
Using Fallback: 1
Result: 1 prospect (using fallback)
```

### With New System (gpt-4o, simplified prompt)
```
After Advanced Filter: 36
Successfully AI Ranked: 0 (0%)
Using Fallback: 8
Result: 8 prospects (using fallback)
```

**Observation:** More prospects passed advanced filter (+4), and more are being returned (+7), but **AI ranking still not working**.

---

## Key Prospects Status

### ‚úÖ Ryan Hutchinson - NOW SHOWING AS QUALIFIED
- **Title:** Director of Operations
- **Score:** 77/100 (seniority fallback)
- **Status:** Qualified (was rejected before)
- **Note:** Using fallback, not AI score

### ‚úÖ Susan Sauder - NOT IN TOP 8
- **Title:** CFO Southern Oregon
- **Company:** Providence
- **Location:** Medford (‚úÖ local)
- **Status:** Passed advanced filter (#4) but didn't make top 8 in seniority ranking

---

## Simplified Prompt Status

### ‚úÖ New Prompt is Loaded

The simplified prompt **is working correctly** and ready to use:

**Old Prompt Format:**
```
Role(38) + Technical(28) + Budget(18) + Exp(9) = 93
```

**New Prompt Format:**
```
Score 0-100 based on:
- 85-100: Perfect match (Director+ Facilities/Engineering/Finance)
- 70-84: Strong prospect (Manager+ facilities/operations/finance)
- 50-69: Possible contact
- 0-49: Not a buyer
```

**Problem:** The prompt is ready, but the AI API calls aren't executing, so the prompt never gets used.

---

## Recommendations

### Immediate Action

1. **Add Debug Logging** - See actual API errors
2. **Test API Key** - Verify gpt-4o access
3. **Try gpt-4o-mini** - Confirm simpler model works

### If API Issues Continue

**Use Fallback System** - It's actually working pretty well:
- Ryan Hutchinson: 77/100 (qualified) ‚úÖ
- Paul Ziegele (CFO): 100/100 ‚úÖ
- Matt Elliott (Director Environmental Services): 88/100 ‚úÖ

The seniority-based fallback is identifying good prospects, just not as intelligently as AI would.

### When GPT-5 Becomes Available

Once OpenAI releases GPT-5 to the API:
1. Update model to `gpt-5`
2. Add reasoning parameters (`minimal`, `low`, `medium`, `high`)
3. Simplified prompt is already ready to use

---

## Summary

‚úÖ **What's Working:**
- Pipeline finding good prospects
- Advanced filtering working well
- Fallback system identifying qualified prospects
- New simplified prompt loaded and ready

‚ùå **What's Broken:**
- AI ranking API calls (100% failure rate)
- No detailed error logging to diagnose
- GPT-5 not available yet

üéØ **Bottom Line:**
System is functional using fallback rankings, but needs AI ranking fixed to reach full potential. Ryan Hutchinson now shows as qualified (77/100 via fallback), which is an improvement over complete rejection.

---

**Status:** Partially Working (Fallback Mode)
**Next Step:** Debug OpenAI API call failures
**ETA to Fix:** 30-60 minutes with proper error logging
