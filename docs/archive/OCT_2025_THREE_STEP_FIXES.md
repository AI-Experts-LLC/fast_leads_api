# October 2025 - Three-Step Pipeline Fixes

**Date**: October 20-21, 2025
**Status**: âœ… Production Ready
**Success Rate**: 69% (9/13 hospitals)

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Problems Solved

### 1. Company Name Matching Failures
**Issue**: "St. Patrick Hospital" vs "Saint Patrick Hospital MT" caused 100% validation failures

**Root Cause**:
- LinkedIn profiles use inconsistent naming: "St." vs "Saint"
- State abbreviations appended: "Hospital MT", "Medical Center ID"
- Multiple spaces after removing healthcare suffixes

**Solution**:
```python
# three_step_prospect_discovery.py:673-675, 843-873
- Normalize: "St." â†’ "Saint", "st " â†’ "saint "
- Remove suffixes: "Medical Center", "Hospital", "Health System"
- Remove state abbreviations: " MT", " ID", " CA", etc.
- Collapse whitespace: "saint patrick  mt" â†’ "saint patrick"
```

**Impact**: Company validation success increased from 0% to 69%

### 2. LinkedIn Company Field Extraction
**Issue**: Apify returns `companyName: null` even when experience array has valid data

**Root Cause**:
- Apify's LinkedIn scraper doesn't always populate top-level `companyName` field
- Valid company data exists in `experience[0].company`

**Solution**:
```python
# linkedin.py:180-185
current_company = raw_data.get('companyName')
if not current_company and experience:
    # Fallback to most recent experience
    current_company = experience[0].get('company')
```

**Impact**: Resolved 100% of "No company listed" failures

---

### 3. Employment Status Validation
**Issue**: Parent health system prospects flagged as "not employed"

**Example**:
- Search: "St. Patrick Hospital"
- LinkedIn shows: "Providence Health & Services"
- Result: Incorrectly flagged as different company

**Solution**:
```python
# three_step_prospect_discovery.py:843-873
- Enhanced _generate_company_variations() with St/Saint normalization
- Checks both local name ("St. Patrick") and parent ("Providence")
- Generates variations: ["St. Patrick Hospital", "Saint Patrick Hospital", ...]
```

**Impact**: Parent health system prospects now correctly validated

## ðŸ“Š Production Test Results

**Test Date**: October 20, 2025
**Dataset**: 13 hospitals in Montana & Idaho
**Processing Time**: 25.2 minutes total

### Success Metrics

| Metric | Value |
|--------|-------|
| Hospitals Processed | 13 |
| **Successful** | **9 (69%)** |
| Failed | 4 (31%) |
| Total Prospects | 23 qualified |
| Avg Time/Hospital | 116 seconds |
| Avg Prospects/Successful | 2.6 |

### Top Performers

## ðŸ’¡ Key Learnings

### What Worked Well

1. **Normalized Name Matching**: St/Saint normalization solved majority of issues
2. **Fallback Extraction**: Experience array fallback fixed null company fields
3. **State Abbreviations**: Removing " MT", " ID" improved matching significantly
4. **Parallel Testing**: Batch script enabled rapid testing of fixes

### What Could Improve

1. **Connection Threshold**: 50 connections may be too high for smaller facilities
2. **Employment Validation**: Could add "last updated" date check for LinkedIn profiles
3. **Parent Company Search**: Could automatically detect and search parent health systems
4. **Location Filter**: Could make state-level matching more flexible (neighboring states)

### Recommendations

1. **Connection Threshold**: Consider lowering to 25 for hospitals with low social media presence
2. **Timeout Handling**: 3-step pipeline works well; avoid single-call improved pipeline on Railway
3. **CSV Export**: Always use batch_all_hospitals_full_export.py for production runs
4. **Health System Data**: Maintain mapping of hospitals to parent systems for better search
