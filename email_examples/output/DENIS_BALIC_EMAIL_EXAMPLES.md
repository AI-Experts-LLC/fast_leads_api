Denis, impressive Castle Solar Farm work

### Email Body
Hey Denis,

I saw you took on the Senior Energy Engineer role at Intermountain Health about a year and a half ago—congrats on the progress since then, especially the Castle Solar Farm launch.

I imagine in your role, you're constantly balancing aging equipment upgrades with tight capital budgets and emergency repair costs.

Since 2009, Metrus Energy has helped nearly 1,000 facilities handle infrastructure upgrades (HVAC, chillers, lighting, controls) with no upfront capital through our Energy-as-a-Service model. We fund, install, and maintain everything.

Would this be worth exploring for Intermountain's facilities?

I noticed Intermountain Health just wrapped up the Castle Solar Farm project—impressive to see 20 MWh of clean energy coming online.

Hey Denis,

I saw Intermountain Health launched the Castle Solar Farm earlier this year—great to see clean energy scaling across your facilities.

Quick question: what if you could upgrade aging HVAC, chillers, and lighting systems without using any capital budget?

We've been helping healthcare teams do exactly that since 2009—nearly 1,000 facilities and counting. We fund, install, and maintain everything through Energy-as-a-Service.

Worth a quick conversation to see if this fits Intermountain's goals?

## Analysis & Recommendations

### Best for Denis Balic:
- **Email 1 or 3**: Denis has a strong sustainability track record (Castle Solar Farm, fleet electrification, anesthetic gas reduction), so rapport-first or social proof will resonate
- **Email 5**: Sports reference adds warmth without being cheesy—Utah Jazz is a safe, unifying reference

### A/B Testing Strategy:
- **Test A**: Email 1 (Rapport-First) vs. Email 3 (Social Proof)
- **Test B**: Email 4 (Curiosity Gap) for contrast
- **Use Email 5 sparingly** (10-20% of sends) to avoid humor fatigue

### Key Personalization Elements:
- ✅ Castle Solar Farm (major recent achievement)
- ✅ Tenure at Intermountain (1 yr 7 mos—still proving himself)
- ✅ Sustainability focus (clean fleet, anesthetic gas, solar)
- ✅ Location (Salt Lake City, Utah Jazz)
- ✅ Title (Senior Energy Engineer—decision-maker authority)

### Avoid:
- ❌ Overly specific references to 70% anesthetic gas reduction (too creepy)
- ❌ Mentioning his previous roles (sPower, AES)—keep focus on current job
- ❌ Multiple links or attachments (hurts deliverability)
