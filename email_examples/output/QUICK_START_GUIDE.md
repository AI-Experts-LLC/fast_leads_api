❌ **Too long** (130+ words) → Mobile readers will skip
❌ **Too formal** ("Dear Sir/Madam") → Feels robotic
❌ **Too specific** ("Congrats on $17.9M project") → Creepy
❌ **Too generic** ("I did research on your company") → Copy-paste feel
❌ **Hard CTA** ("Book a 30-min meeting") → Too pushy
❌ **Multiple links** (website, calendar, LinkedIn) → Hurts deliverability
❌ **M-dashes** (em dashes) → AI tell, spam filter trigger

## 🎬 Real Example Walkthrough

### Scenario: Emailing a Director of Facilities at a Montana hospital

**Step 1**: Choose **Prompt 2 (Value-Direct)** (mid-level manager, needs quick-scan)

**Step 2**: Gather data:
- Contact: Sarah Johnson, Director of Facilities, 3 years at hospital
- Account: Community Medical Center, Missoula, MT, $17.9M Heart Center project

**Step 3**: Generate with Prompt 2, get this output:
> Subject: Zero-CapEx infrastructure for Community Medical
>
> Hi Sarah,
>
> As Director of Facilities at Community Medical Center, I imagine you're dealing with aging equipment, pressure to reduce energy costs, and rising emergency repair expenses—all while managing tight capital budgets.
>
> Metrus Energy helps healthcare teams solve this. Since 2009, we've funded, installed, and operated energy efficiency projects for nearly 1,000 facilities with no upfront capital.
>
> We handle HVAC, chillers, boilers, lighting, controls, backup power—design through maintenance.
>
> Would this be worth exploring for Community Medical?
>
> Best,
> Andrew

**Step 4**: Human edit (looks good! Just verify no m-dashes, check word count = 87 ✅)

**Step 5**: Send via Outreach.io, schedule for 9am Tuesday
