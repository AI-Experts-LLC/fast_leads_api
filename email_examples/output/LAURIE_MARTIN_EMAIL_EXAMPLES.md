## Analysis & Recommendations

### Best for Laurie Martin:
- **Email 1 or 3**: Laurie has 8+ years at St. Luke's and just got promoted to Director—she's proving herself in a new role. Rapport-first or social proof will resonate.
- **Email 2**: Direct value approach works well for capital project managers who are budget-conscious and results-driven.
- **Email 5**: Boise State Broncos reference adds local warmth—safe, unifying sports team for Idaho

### A/B Testing Strategy:
- **Test A**: Email 1 (Rapport-First) vs. Email 2 (Value-Direct)
- **Test B**: Email 3 (Social Proof) for credibility-driven prospects
- **Use Email 5 sparingly** (10-20% of sends) for personality differentiation

### Key Personalization Elements:
- ✅ Promotion to Director (Sept 2024—recent, still proving herself)
- ✅ Heart & Vascular Center expansion (major project leadership)
- ✅ Multi-million dollar interior refresh (completed April 2025)
- ✅ 8+ years at St. Luke's (institutional knowledge, trusted internally)
- ✅ Location (Meridian/Boise, Idaho—Boise State Broncos)
- ✅ Title (Director of Capital Project Management—budget authority)

### Avoid:
- ❌ Mentioning her previous athletic trainer career (too far back, not relevant)
- ❌ Overly specific project details (square footage, exact dollar amounts—too creepy)
- ❌ References to other Idaho healthcare systems (could seem like competitor research)
- ❌ Multiple links or attachments (hurts deliverability)

### Why These Work for Laurie:
1. **Budget Authority**: As Director of Capital Project Management, she directly controls infrastructure spending decisions
2. **Pain Points**: Managing capital budgets, aging equipment, emergency repairs—all directly addressable by Metrus
3. **Recent Promotion**: She's 1 year into this role (Sept 2024), so she's motivated to prove herself with smart, cost-effective solutions
4. **Project Leadership**: Her recent interior refresh shows she manages large-scale projects—Metrus EaaS fits her workflow
