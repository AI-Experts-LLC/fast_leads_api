Transcript:
 
Them: Good, good. How are you?  
Me: Yeah. Tomorrow. Take your place.  
Them: Nice. I got a new phone yesterday and I've been playing with it. That's what I've been doing.  
Me: Are you? Locking.  
Them: 17. As one phone.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: And then with my plan. So this is actually my mattress phone, I guess. I got the google pixel 9 pro.  
Me: A buddy of mine literally just switched. From a pixel. Love to the pixel way more.  
Them: It's really cool. Like, I've been using it a little bit. There's so many. Cool. Like, the camera alone is really cool.  
Me: Oh, my goodness.  
Them: It lets you put yourself into photos. So, like, if you take a group photo, you can add yourself in. It's really cool. There's always, like, neat stuff.  
Me: That sounds nefarious.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: How do you think I'm more than one word. Everyone to have.  
Them: Yeah. Yeah. No, it's. It's cool.  
Me: Andrew, if you see me like. First I'm texting you when I switch to Green Bubble, and then you see me posting on LinkedIn and I'm with all these different celebrities. One day I'm with Bill Gates, the next day I'm with Sam Allman. How did that happen?  
Them: Yeah. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Have you. Have you checked out the new Gemini thing that came out? Have you played with it at all? Is it cool?  
Me: It's cool. So they have a new ide, like a development environment. And I've been messing with that a little bit as well. Gemini3 is now the most capable model. On all but software engineering. So I'm specifically that one test of capability. Claude is still winning, but in every way Gemini 3 is better. And the redevelopment environment. You can just use unlimited Gemini 3 for free right now, which is subsidized in the whole thing.  
Them: Oh, wow.  
Me: So yeah. If you're curious about it. It's called antigravity. You could go and install it and click around.  
Them: Yeah, interesting. Anti gravity. Yeah, it was. I was talking to one of my friends about Google stock, too.  
Me: Do. What?  
Them: Yeah, it's been on like a tear, so, like. Yeah. Year to date, it's up like 55%. Which is, like, huge.  
Me: Yeah. That's incredible.  
Them: I think that's better than the video.  
Me: Right.  
Them: Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, it's not small. And then I think it's because a bunch of people started buying it. Like, what's it called? Warren Buffett started buying it. Maybe it caused, like, a bit of a. Positivity.  
Me: In google. Wow.  
Them: Yeah, he dumped his Apple shares, and Peter Thiel dumped his Nvidia shares, so everyone started getting worried.  
Me: Right.  
Them: I guess people went to Google. I don't know. This is. It's social thing too, I guess.  
Me: N. Vidia was kind of like. Leading. What people thought was the beginning of the top of the AI bubble yesterday.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: And then after. Hours. Nvidia posted just record earnings again and the stock shot up 6% or something. Room at Nasdaq with a bunch of door people like six week leaders and someone gets up on stage and says just not to sign the Alarm. Nvidia is up 6% after hours. I think we're all going to be okay. And this is like, this side of the list in the room because everybody's better talking about AI.  
Them: Yeah. That's so funny. What? What were you doing, like a speech or something?  
Me: No. In this case, I was just an attendee. These folks were. Higher caliber than me. Like Harvard graduates and stuff. But I was learning. Quite a lot.  
Them: Okay. Those are too short, but, yeah, no, that's cool. That's really cool.  
Me: Yeah. Thank you. So I'm super excited to chat. I feel like. I've done a good bit of, like, asynchronous research and looking into this problem. I'm sure you have a lot of ideas now that you've been poking around.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Did you want to start? Did you want to kind of walk me through what you're doing? Right now. With the emails, or would you prefer what I start with just kind of. The prompts that I'm using and things like that.  
Them: Can we give you a little bit of. Sorry. Okay. It's got an IT ticket I got to do. Sorry, I got distracted. Yeah. So some updates on what we've been doing with email so far, so I bought another. So right now we're warming up metrics. Energy.com. We're also warming up two mailboxes on Metras Energy Net.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: So like, my same email at Net and then like Ahrdelli at Metric Energy. Net. So hopefully that'll be done in the next little bit. You know, we use that. I think we're targeting whatever it was. 2,000 emails a month, something like that. Plus or minus. To do a marketing campaign, so that's. That's been a process. You know, I ran the deliverability tests through Warme. It does it, like, every week. We got upgraded because we have three accounts, and we got upgraded to higher package, so we get, like, test testing for that. We actually have really good deliverability. Like. Very good. Like, excellent. So I'm kind of surprised. But also happy.  
Me: Now that you have zero. Bound. Or what was it called? It's not here about that we paid for.  
Them: Plugin. Yeah.  
Me: Now that you have that. Effectively. You should be getting everything delivered. Is that the right idea?  
Them: That's the plan. Yeah. I mean, we got. We have a way lower bounce rate, maybe below 1%.  
Me: Yeah. That's incredible.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Okay? So now the problem is we just need people to reply. We need to figure out the copy that I listed to response. Is that right?  
Them: Yeah. And I know that that might not be great, like I was hoping that you told us all the wrong, but this is a much easier problem to solve. In my mind because this is, like, all within our control now. Like, if it's a matter of email copy, we can play around with that. We can. We can optimize that. That's not hard. This other stuff with a little bit out of our hands and kind of difficult, but this is not bad.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: So I had another question for you on this topic. So one thing, we have a metras that I'm sure every company got. In whatever last Microsoft update. Is this thing called the quarantine. Thing. You familiar with what that is? You have that on your inbox?  
Me: Like a firewall that dumps suspicious emails.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: So. I'm wondering if our emails are ending up in that. Because that's not technically spam, so it won't show up as a spam thing, I guess. But it just sits there. And then people will look at it and realize, like a sales email. And they hit delete. Or, you know, I think. I don't know, our company, we don't do this. But I can imagine that at other places that maybe have more intense security. Like, if you want to release it from that, you might have to, I don't know. A ticket. Someone has to review it. Right? Like, it didn't sound like that'd be out of the question or something. It gets flagged to it. Why are you releasing these people? Just don't do it. So I was wondering if you knew anything about that or heard about that at all.  
Me: I'm assuming that every company has some degree, maybe varying degrees, of course, of firewall like that. And even if somebody is like a small startup using this Google sheet off the shelf,  
Them: All.  
Me: It's trying to filter out promotions. I don't know if your personal Gmail you probably have a whole backlog of things that are just sales emails that you have never actually looked at because they're in that separate folder. And so, yeah, it might be a matter of us hanging around with the wording and the language so that it doesn't trigger any of those filters, any of those flags. And then fortunately, I think our metrics still attract. The number to make go up is just a reply rate. So if we're sending thousands of emails. And we get. Replies, that'll always be a good sign. Right. What do the reply is hey, don't bug me anymore. Which is actually a good thing to receive because getting a reply, I've heard, actually helps boost your sort of deliverability and all that stuff.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: So. Whether it's a reply of somebody saying, hey, this isn't for me. Or reply to somebody saying, very interested. Let's talk for five minutes. You're very interested. Tell me more. I think worth eliciting. Do you have any other way, though, that you can measure if it's ended up in a quarantine? I mean, is there. It. Wouldn't bounce, that's for sure. It would show delivered. What a show. Maybe is not open. Do you have an open trigger set up in someone?  
Them: Yep. So we do. But I turned it off. Because I heard from someone that that decreases deliverability.  
Me: Yep. I heard that. Too.  
Them: Right, which sucks. And then I'm not sure. I need to maybe follow up with it, because remember, they were going to add those CNAME records. Or something that we're going to create something so we could have, like, our own it.  
Me: I am an spf, that kind of stuff.  
Them: No, it's something else. So in outreach, and you send an email to someone with those. Those tracking things, I guess, uses some kind of link. And it's a generic outreach. It still works, but it's like a generic outreach one. And the problem with that is. Spam filters flag that as a marketing sales email. Where it would come. So instead of being like blah blah blah and I'll reach dot com, it would come as blah blah blah metrics dot com. So I guess that wouldn't flag the spam stuff as much.  
Me: To do that. You need fit to go in and put it into your domain. Record.  
Them: That's right.  
Me: Okay? They haven't done that. Takes. Five, ten minutes to do over. Zoom. Like if we had a long on the phone right now. We could. Log in. And do that.  
Them: Yeah, I don't think it's hard. I think we just got. It got delayed because we were trying to do the. I think so the custom object or something. I forgot what it was. Maybe something like that. Anyways, I got to look up how to do it again. But the reason we didn't do it was because we were getting the whole domain set up. So we just focused on that first, but I think that that's something we should do. So I'll. I'll take that as that's my follow up, but.  
Me: Well, I think that's awesome. I think all of that sounds really good. So then, do you think. The quarant. Ine thing. Really quickly. Unmute.  
Them: Yeah, like, for example, the warm emails. Almost all of them go to quarantine. So every day I wake up my inbox.  
Me: You paid for me and they're sending you weekly updates or something?  
Them: Yeah. So warmy email.  
Me: On their quarantine settings.  
Them: I have no idea. Every day I wake up, I have an email from Microsoft saying, you have 50 messages in quarantine. I have to go and click release 50 times to open them all. And then it gets archived.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: And it started to slow down a little bit, I think, because I guess once you do it enough times, it just starts to, like, maybe it learns through a behavior or something, I don't know. If you're constantly releasing the same email, same type of emails, maybe it lets you but. I Andrew if that's an issue too, which is really hard to track.  
Me: Right. And I Andrew too. I mean. Look, other folks are doing all kinds of emails. I get all these email updates from Verizon. That's for the example that I use, because it's a company that I've never wanted to receive email from, but they still have to contact me for billing and all that kind of stuff.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: And they're doing it. At a scale that they can't even comprehend. Millions of customers. And so there has to be a way to get through these filters and these quarantine systems. My hunch would be it's just about choosing the right wording. Like, I know for a fact that these systems filter for trigger words. Like if you talk about. Sale. Or discount or money in any way, shape or form, then it probably will get flagged. But maybe what we could do is.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: When we start to land on some copy that we think is good, maybe we can a B test with a version that. Is amazing. But. Deliberately removes everything we think could be spent. Have you seen this website where you could paste in the whole email and then it'll tell you what it'll likely spend? Filter works.  
Them: Now. Let's go. Should do that.  
Me: So we could paste it into one of those sites and get some estimate on whether it's going to be. Selected Likely to be triggered 5% likely to be triggered. Let's reduce down to zero and then do an AB test and see if there's, like, a higher rate you receive from one or the other.  
Them: Yeah, that's a good idea.  
Me: One of the things I was thinking about, too. And I don't know if this is an. Artifact your job. I'm not sure if it's a part of mine, but ways that we catch people who land on the site. Out of curiosity, but maybe didn't respond to the email. So maybe they open the click through.  
Them: Oh, we have. We have a way to do that with zoom info.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: You. They added that code to the website, so we can actually do that. Yeah. Another thing to. Another thing I thought about, too, is it's interesting that you had such a big uptick. Because her enemy telegram marketing KPIs. So it's really interesting that we had such a huge increase in website visits. But no meetings. Or no one respond to the email, so it makes me think. Yeah. Where is it? Here. Yeah. Okay. Question. Is it possible. Yeah. Where's our impressions 0 line September. Yeah. Like september. Website analytics. Yeah, we had a huge uptake in September, and then I kind of filled it off a bit. Right when I started late that week. Is there a reason why, like, or there's some automated reason why that's happening? Or is there no way that that be. There must be real people.  
Me: You're wondering if. This box is doing the site.  
Them: Yeah, like, I don't know, like this. This, like screening tools or like, checking out the website or something, or they're putting some. They're. They're tripping the. The view thing without actually being real. Real people, you know what I mean?  
Me: There are. Traffic monitors that can do a decent job of distinguishing. But that would be another pixel you have to add to the website. And decently complex. I'm not sure if it would do worth. Any of our effort. To try to figure out, human or not.  
Them: This is good. I mean, this is Google Analytics. Was that? I guess they can. It's probably decent, right?  
Me: It's a decent some of these things. Too. I was just talking to a guy yesterday, actually, who's doing. Bot tracking. Across the web. He's on a Facebook. Google. But the major ad platforms, they don't actually want to know, they don't want to identify. That from human. As. Much as they can. They wring their hands with the problem because it's better for their business if everything is traffic. More traffic is more ad dollars. It's more revenue for them. So they have. N't done, what would be like would be a good faith effort. To distinguish.  
Them: Right. Yeah. Just. Yeah. Bare minimum. Yeah. Because this don't understand like why so why so many people would see the email go on our website? And then not reply.  
Me: Curiosity, I suppose. I'll get emails from. Other founders who are building something that I'm not interested in remotely.  
Them: Right.  
Me: Here's this new tool when I built it, does exactly what I'm already doing just fine without them. But I'm so curious about what they're building. And if it looks like they have any traction doing it and stuff.  
Them: Yeah. Okay, everybody, right. I don't know. Sorry. I'm just scratching my head with this thing. I. I don't know. I feel like.  
Me: Are they dealt a link in the email or they visiting via Google.  
Them: Via google, I guess. Yeah. Google.  
Me: Accessibility.  
Them: Cl. Actually, I don't really know. Sorry I said that, but I actually don't know. I used to have a. I used to have a link in the emails, but I took it out. Like just our website.  
Me: Yeah. Because I think the link was supposedly something that hurts the liverlogy, too, right?  
Them: Yeah, but I don't know. I feel like every email I've ever sent, I just. I don't know. In our last job, maybe because we're such a big company. We had that Verizon level. Email placement, because if people get their power bills and all that stuff through that system, So we were always landing people's inboxes. Like, we usually get tons of tons of meeting emails. You know, it was like going fishing. I'd be on vacation getting meetings booked because we automated.  
Me: Oh, that's so cool.  
Them: It was great.  
Me: So let's talk about the email then for a second. What were you saying to these folks that made them little fucking meetings so bad?  
Them: I don't know. Nothing crazy. I wouldn't even do research. It was generic. It would just be like, hi, I did some research on your company. So I had some goals around reducing emissions. I would drop a line saying where one of the biggest renewable energy advisors and then list out what we offer. And then ask them for time. I had links, pictures, everything you're not supposed to do. Link tracking, like everything. All automated. Yeah, there never had any problems.  
Me: And. How long is this yesterday? Are we talking about.  
Them: August.  
Me: Before quarantines. August. Okay.  
Them: So when they leave, when did they put my job at an L? September 14th. Up until September 14th. That's a fine strategy.  
Me: Already won leads. Like where did you get the email from?  
Them: That cold from zoom info.  
Me: Wow.  
Them: Now, the mean difference, though, the main difference, to be fair. Those were commercial, industrial, not healthcare. So we need to have different expectations. I think it's a very different industry. Different business. But still. I don't know. I just. I'm just so confused about why. You know? Doesn't work. Market could also be a little different too. Means a different product. But. Yeah.  
Me: The advertiser and. Mike See the kind of. Email systems they're using the computers they're using. Party One is that these people are just barely scraping by on email at all. If it's a business bill a little bit more physical than digital.  
Them: Kaiser's like a hospital network.  
Me: I'm. Sorry. Yeah. Er, just one of the many large hospitals in California.  
Them: Okay, okay.  
Me: Mentally thinking of it because that's what I was a member of. But rather just hospitals in general. They tend to, at least in my experience, be. A Dell box computer sitting in front of, like, a monitor that's disguised. It's a square aspect ratio. And. They tend to be windows xp houses. Not like modern enterprise grade productivity. Email machines.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: That's been my experience.  
Them: I think you're generally right. I mean, even just a small gnaws at the dentist the other day. You know, small organization, but obviously one office or two, whatever they are. But yeah, that's what it looked like. Really older people using them too. Like. Yeah. All this weird healthcare software on there. Not like stuff that, you know, we would use. I mean, that could be part of it, too. Like, maybe it's just. Maybe it's not an email. Email friendly business. Which is fine. I switched over the sequences a little bit now, so more call heavy.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: Which. Which is fine. Like, I'm not. I don't. I don't mind about doing the calling part. It's just. It's a lot of work. There's no scale.  
Me: Yeah. Quantity of and it's sort of like optimization of the current system. Could we do such that we prove it to be entirely false? Or potentially working.  
Them: Yeah. Okay. Good question. I think we need to send a lot more messages. Like, I think that's really the bottleneck, too. Like, although we feel like we're sending a lot, we're really not. Like, I swear, when I was at an now, like, you know, we would send out, like, Like, I would have people in email only sequences and people in emails and call sequences. Right. So I would focus on calling the best people. And it takes time to build up a book. Sort of. Right. Like, you're not going to get thousands and thousands of people in a system in one month. Like, it takes time to build that up. But, yeah, like, I think. I think we need to definitely scale it up. Like, I think we need to get so we can send about, I think, 4,000 emails a month or 5,000 with the current warm up thing we're doing. So I think we need to get higher. And maybe that's. Maybe that's just the issue. Like, we're just not getting enough volume. And then Bob sent me some commercial industrial customers, too. So I think we can also kind of diversify our pipeline a little bit, and that would also be a good, I think, test. Because we're not getting any meetings also with them, then, okay? Then we really need to reevaluate our. Email strategy or if it's just a hospital thing. So, like, I was talking to, like, Purine, Al, There's a couple different companies. I've been messaging. So maybe a little bit that. But how did, how do things go with the, the full email development idea we were talking about? Did you, did you look at that yet? I don't remember if we decided on the next for that.  
Me: Multiple. Screen share here if you don't.  
Them: Yeah. Sure.  
Me: So you should see. Can you see my tab here? Take a google. Doc.  
Them: Yep, I can see. Yep.  
Me: Okay? So the reason I sent you this, I was hoping to get your perspective on. How we can craft an email, which is objectively good. And. I didn't want to do a whole. Bunch of extensive prompting before we knew what that final form should look like. So if there's a way that you and I can arrive at maybe even just from a past example of an email that you sent already from outreach, that worked really well. But if you get a lot of an example or two, Of great email sequences that I can definitely craft. That system right now.  
Them: Yes.  
Me: Just by way of, like, quick oversharing. But just wanted to. Show you how it's actually working. So right now, the way that we're setting up the email system, Is here. Let me find it. In here. There it is. So. Essentially, we take in the. Whole contact and account record. With the LinkedIn data, right? Their headline, their skills, experience, that kind of stuff. And from there, we build this stuff. So these are three separate. Individual prompts. And. One prompt is grabbing the rapport. It's like this first kind of sentences that are personalized. In four different versions. One prompt is generating. The summary, the other kind of, like, details and descriptions and such, but primarily that second sentence as well. And then finally, we generate kind of like these ultimate. Combination element that goes across the account. That's interesting, Salesforce. Importantly. This is. I think that can immediately improve right now.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: We're qualifying it. And so what we did. I don't know if you remember, but the first time we did this first section, B step. When we had the output, it looked super robotic. It was like. I can see that. You just raised 15 million last week for a new heating and air conditioning facility improvement and window upgrade for your hospital. Congratulations. It was, like, way too detailed.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: And. Maybe some of that is good. We do need some of that detail. I'm not. Sure what? The right amount. Is. And so what happened is it was too much. It was too robotic and too detailed. Almost creepily specific. And so we passed it through another prompt. This prompt, the only job is to make it sound more human. To dumb it down. Literally.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: So instead of saying. Like. Congratulations. To mayo clinic north regional hospital. Nine, five, seven, four, seven. Congrats. Just moved on LinkedIn that you did something, something with funding level, conversational. On the other hand. Now it gets more general. And so if it's conversational, more general, you're finding more human. But also it could just be something that's so general that it's copy pasted, and then maybe they don't notice either.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: So there's middle down there that I'd love to figure out with you.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: And then lastly, I'll just share. There's some validators and checks we have in place to make sure that before it's inserted into Salesforce, That the data is. Like matching what it needs to be for Salesforce. So now we're going to insert the Salesforce. Willy nilly without first checking that things look decent. And then we'll go back to the apps. Too. So that's kind of the way the process is working right now for updating all these fields.  
Them: Yeah. Okay, cool. Is there a reason you chose. Gpt4, not 5.1.  
Me: So. It depends on the. Prompt. GPT4 is significantly cheaper. And so 40 is actually a better writer, just in particular for crafting writing. A better writer at the cost than even. GPT 5. On specific comps, you have to prompt it real wrong. GPT 5. Search is used up above. I don't know where that is. So this is actually. Out here. Okay, so we're using gpt4 miniseries. So gpt4 minisearch will gather the data. But GPT file search was. Like two or three times more expensive. I can't remember what the number was. So. I promise. It's effective and it's working. But in some cases, you could spend 20 cents or you could spend 2 cents in one, not spend two.  
Them: Yeah, that's basically the same or whatever. Who cares? Yeah.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: So we're not doing anything that intensive that needs maybe. Etsy model. I was just curious.  
Me: Yeah. And we can always swap those out and experiment. But, you know, kind of it in my back and forth process. That was. What was working well, and then. Let's see here. Here's an example really quickly, just for both of us to see as well. The way that it's transforming. So this is the prompt that described to you where it's dumbing it down, making it human. So saying you're reviewing your poor building email sentences. The reason I say listen is we could do all of this on the whole email. It doesn't have to be done just sentence by sentence, right? So these prompts. We can expand and build these for the Andrew email, but we really got to get all this right.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Or else we'll just create number emails that are the same, you know, ineffective result. If we do. So I think right now, the prompts, what they're trying to do is this, like, congratulations on Cleveland Clinic recruiting issues. The top workplace in healthcare ranking 37th large. So it's like, too much, right? We would type this.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Then instead of saying, I noticed a recognition your team at Cleveland Clinic got congratulations. On the other hand, that's so vague, you could say that you could insert this name here. And just say, like, Mayo Clinic.  
Them: It's like some of you do an outreach with the variables. Yeah.  
Me: Exactly. So we've gone to General. Now, that being said, these prompts are working. They're doing what we want them to do. And so if we just prompt it differently, we can absolutely get a different email. And so that's where we get to. Kind of the different email versions. Or maybe you and I can shot through. Really, really get detailed about it. And I can spend an hour thinking about it on my own time here after our call. But. What is going to make people respond, what they respond to. We've got a free PDF download that will tell you everything you need to do to increase energy efficiency this year. Or will it respond to Hey. Let's hop on the phone for a five minute call. Just send me what time you want me to call and I'll call you directly at that time. When they respond. To some sort of stat or study or something that says, hey, this client saved a million dollars. I just don't know.  
Them: Yes. Yeah, I don't know either. It's interesting because I was talking to Lisa from Outreach. A while ago, too, and she was saying, try to be, like, a little bit softer. When you ask people for a meeting, like, don't be so direct about it. So I just sent you an email. That I. This is basically the format I've been assigned to people where it's a little softer, so if you want to take a look at that as well. I don't know if that's. I don't know if that's actually true or not. I mean, I was always a little more direct about it, but maybe that's the way to be, too. So. If you want to take a look, you can review it. Yeah. I think the first one is like a follow up, and you scroll down and you can see, like the. The first email.  
Me: Did you send it to my mattress email by chance?  
Them: No. Oh, sorry. And I have so many outreach problems through my emails. Don't send. It says outreach is working. Any requests and it's just spinning. Yeah.  
Me: Oh, no.  
Them: Yeah. Ben's got mad at me, like, a few times, to be honest, because he's like, well, why didn't you send this person an email? I'm like, I did. The first time it happened, I was so gaslit. I was like, did I have, like, a mental block where I just didn't do something, even though I wrote the email or whatever? But no, it got stuck in my inbox. Just sat there doing it. Right now I was working across spin, spin, spin.  
Me: Is it? Is it? Outreach is designed to send emails slowly. Like gradually. Is that what.  
Them: No lag. It's garbage. Steve's gonna log me out. Yeah. Logged me out. Why not? Let me tell you that, though.  
Me: Dreaming. I don't know. This is probably not sort of dreamy. I've been dreaming about, like, a chat experience for sales.  
Them: Right.  
Me: Just go into chat, you could say. Find me 10 directors of facilities and hospitals in Northern California, and then we'd give you, like, a little bit. And then be like, okay, for each of those, please pull up their phone number and their email address and be like, this is a fun email address. And then you say, okay. Now, for each person on this list, initiate a phone call and send them an outreach message personalized to their local sports team. Emails and then they would back up to a CRM somewhere, but all you have to look at is, like, the chat window that tells you that it was actually done.  
Them: Yeah. Yeah. No. It'd be really nice. Yeah. Be really, really nice. I was looking into some other companies that do similarly. Some are kind of stuff like you ever heard, like Reply IO. It's very similar to what we're trying to do, actually. So you want to take a look at that?  
Me: Yeah. Fill up your sales pipeline. Audience discovery.  
Them: Yeah, there's one called a.I. sdr agent.  
Me: You told me about this. You did?  
Them: Yeah. And another conversation with another AI Cold calling company how that works. But it's not very good, though, because I think there's rules around I. Apparently, you can't have an AI Cold call. People can only do warm leads.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Good thing. General. Ly speaking.  
Them: Not to go to Optavic, off topic, but one time we were looking at these types of things. And we thought, like, what if we hire people, like, overseas to do the cold calling? For us. And so we're talking on these outsourcing companies with, like, offices in the Philippines, Colombia, all these places. So funny. Not funny. A little bit sad, but, like, the way that they, like, pitch their service. Like one guy literally pulled up a live video stream of their office. You just see, like, rows of people sitting in this, like, dark office. And all of a sudden a computers. And then he points out, see the guy at the end of the. At the end of the line, he's like the manager. Make sure I was doing their work. Right. And it literally looks like a freaking human trafficking investigation. Like there's a guy standing there at the end of with his arms crossed. And does all these workers. And I was like, yeah, I gotta go. I literally left the calls. I can get out of this.  
Me: Culturally different. It's like no human rights. Oh, no.  
Them: Yeah. Yeah. I was like, well, this is an off camera. I don't know what this is. Imagine. Feel like this is gonna be on, you know, one of those investigative news TV shows one day.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Like. Yeah.  
Me: Man. I hope all those people with AI right. I was looking at a slide yesterday that somebody presented where they said, US talent, and then it filled the prices for sales. For engineering, for customer service. And then add offshore that it outsourced talent and then had dramatically lower prices. Like, instead of $30, it's $5. And then. Had AI and it was 20 cents.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: They were literally comparing the two. And if that's really what happens, man, what's going to happen to the Philippines and to Indonesia?  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: I don't know.  
Them: Yeah. It's a varying levels, though. Like, there are some other companies that were good. Like booth and partners. If you ever need to hire someone in their country, they're great. Sales guy's awesome. Awesome guy.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: That they just hire people in other places. It's more like kind of like deal. It's more like a deal versus. The D E E L service that hired me or I employed through versus. Like, whatever. The sweatshop. That felt a little more. A little bit better. More expensive, though. The sweatshop is definitely the cheapest option. Anyways, just. Sorry, it's a side note, but, yeah. Yeah, they're great. Really nice guy. Good people. I heard good reviews.  
Me: Do you want me? I mean, would it be helpful if I said screen again? Or do you want to share yours? Because you could always. Do. Let's take a screen.  
Them: Did you get the. Yeah. Did you get that email yet? Did it send?  
Me: I. Got it. Okay?  
Them: Okay. Yeah. So if you scroll down a little bit, this is an example of some emails I'm assigning to people. Like, I don't know. You can run it through your AI Thing. Take a look at it. You know, I'm like, very. Like I send you another one too. This is a hospital one.  
Me: So the first one is at the bottom, right? November twelveth at 5aM. And the next follow up is eight days later.  
Them: Well, the only reason it's not supposed to be eight days later. But the problem is I had to throttle everything.  
Me: Got it. Okay?  
Them: So it's supposed to be like two or three days later, but I can't because it's, you know. Yeah. I limited it to. Like, I forgot how many emails a day. 100. Not even 100. Like maybe 50. And I've been trying to use the new email address, even though it's not fully warmed up yet. Not really. I guess best practice, but just to get a little bit of volume out.  
Me: Interesting. I'm just here. I'm waiting. By the way. I guess modules.  
Them: Yeah, it's okay. Hey, you ever heard of Wood Mackenzie?  
Me: No.  
Them: Oh, bob is featured on their LinkedIn page. Cool. Sorry. I'm distracting you.  
Me: It's. Fine. Data. And analytics. Nice. One thing I'm taking or wondering. Is. It too worded? Is it too lengthy?  
Them: Yeah. That's a thought. Too long.  
Me: Like I'm reading it. I. Don't work in Delta Split General facility, so maybe this is a typical email for them. But I really am thinking. Okay. Managing delsers, regional facilities. And airport projects. We've likely had to balance modernization, reliability, cost efficiency. We've already gotten. 15 seconds in. And so far, it's all just. Dug into my brain.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Did this? Get a list.  
Them: I can't even give you an email. I haven't gotten any responses.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: I've gotten no feedback, no negative, nor pog. I mean, I guess negative because I never got any responses, but nothing like positive. Or I could say, well, this has been working. This hasn't. Everything's not working.  
Me: So with this, I haven't consulted. An outside. Experts But I have. What I did is I pulled in three. Articles that I found online that were guides to how to develop a good high reply rate called email.  
Them: Cat.  
Me: I added those to tragic PS Context. I gave it a very long prompt. It was like perfectly considered mattresses. Background and. Our poor cards that were targeting and the understanding of the customer. And asked it to kind of do all that and then prepare an analysis about what good emails might look like. One thing super quick here is, like, it's really short. I focus on these here, like where?  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: The sentences are short, the structure is short. Let me see. Somewhere in here it says what the count should be. It. 's like the Andrew email.  
Them: 90 characters or something.  
Me: Yeah. Subject.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: Line, 30 to 50 characters.  
Them: That first point there.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: And that thing you just said is so true. And I think that's maybe one of the big issues. We're talking. It was one of the green check marks. Mobile optimization. It just prompted my mind. I think that's the issue we're having right now. We're dealing with the set of customers that are not at their desks, their facilities people. They're busy, they're looking at on their phone. The email's too long. How do I respond? How do I book a meeting? And that's really long because I'm also looking on my desktop, not on my phone. Actually let me put on my phone. I'm just curious what these emails look like. Because I feel like you're right. I feel like they might look super long.  
Me: I could check right now. Too.  
Them: Yeah. Take a look. Maybe that's the issue. Let's see. I can't even find. My emails are loaded with all these warm up emails. Yeah. Oh, my God, look at this.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Look how long this is.  
Me: It's not too bad, but as long as it paragraph.  
Them: Look at this.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: There's an sd. It's a book. Okay. I figured out the problem. Okay, good.  
Me: It keeps going up. It's good. What if we store it up more like a tweet, just a little bit?  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: And then. I mean, I'm still making to do here. More. And then. We're human. You and I are human. And AI might not be good at this, but we can absolutely clap this into the email. One of the things it doesn't here to use a hitch with a little bit of salt of humor. Something that makes it feel human, that makes it feel like you're connecting with them.  
Them: Yes.  
Me: And I don't know how you prefer to do that. Like, obviously, it needs to be on metrics, brand and on, you know. It has to. Be like a teenager over email. Has to be the right kind of level. But is there something we can think of that would help me with or. Out. Kind of effect.  
Them: To be honest, I don't know. I've never used humor and emails. Such as me, but I don't know. I'm always reminded of that line from Wedding Crashers. You know, you can either be funny or be sincere, but being funny, really hard. There's always some risk with that.  
Me: AI. Came up with. Do you see this here?  
Them: Like it is funny. It is funny, but.  
Me: My service professional, but, like, can't. Can we be funky?  
Them: Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Is there a thing of being funny? I don't know. I like the idea. But. Yeah, I don't know how fits with that brand. I think pin in that, but not a good idea. But I think getting shorter, a little punchier is going to be great.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: So, yeah, I think.  
Me: This is how humans email, right? Where it's like, last reach out. It's quick. It's like I was just typing this, you know? As opposed to if you said. Hi, dennis. This is the last time I plan to reach out to you. Just wanted to express. Maybe you would type that, but it doesn't feel as human to human.  
Them: Yeah. Yeah, it doesn't. You know another weird thing? Can you ask Chat to make subtle grammar mistakes?  
Me: Yeah. What are some examples? I don't want it to. Really boss things. Here.  
Them: I don't know how to describe it. I've asked it to do before. But maybe it's a casual tone thing. Maybe that's what I'm looking at, but sometimes it comes out, like, too perfect. Like, everything is so properly done. Like, the grammar is impeccable, uses semicolons and, like, all these things that, like, I guess, people like English teachers use but no one else does. But. But I think it might also, if we get it shorter, and maybe it'll just fix itself. Right. It was writing these long paragraphs. It just has more opportunities. Or like, oh, can you get it to get rid of those M dashes? Have you heard of this?  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: I heard m. Those dashes are apparently like a. Like a red flag there. It's AI.  
Me: Total. Ly. Yeah. People. It's just so biased. But, yes, 100%.  
Them: Yeah, that's. That's another thing. Yeah, I. I put it on my chat instructions, too, and I would always remove those. Stops using them.  
Me: That's a big win, by the way. Do you know if it a longest time you couldn't even prompt that out, and then Sam Altman released a tweet. That was like small win for the AI community. We've mainstreamed ashes from chat cpt if you ask for it.  
Them: Yeah. You know, I'm so dumb. I just learned how to use personalization instructions, like, literally last week. Oh, my God. So much time gets saved. Oh, just small siblings. Sign up. No m dashes. Sign my emails off with the best instead of like formal regards or whatever I kept putting every time. And. Yeah, anyways, just little things like that. Like I made a project and it was just cool, so. Okay, so I was thinking, too.  
Me: Okay? I love that. First email, or are we crafting the whole sequence?  
Them: That's what I'm thinking. One of us do all of them.  
Me: So. What? 's one thing I'm thinking. Right. The advantage. Of the reason. I think that we set out at the beginning to do. And I promise I'm happy that. I'm happy to do all this if you think it's best. But. One of the things that we gain by doing individual emails there. Codified. In, out. Reach. Is. You can quickly ad test things, you can change it. But you can see Did I improve or did I regress? If every email is a unique butterfly. We have no way to measure what's working, what's not.  
Them: Okay?  
Me: Better for us. To. Really rack our brain about. Portions of the email that we want personalized. And then. Let the recipe. Rock solid. And then we can tweak on the left. We can tweak individual portions, so we know. That's working.  
Them: Yeah, okay. That's a fair point. Well, because I guess at the end of the day, too, I mean, what. What personalization are we really going to add in emails 2, 3, 4, 5, 6? Like, it's basically just going to be like, reply to this. And, yeah, we. It's basically going to be the same. So, yeah, maybe.  
Me: Do you have these? By the way. Are you kind of customizing every time? You get a reply.  
Them: Lucas Eban. I tried a lot of those emails.  
Me: No. Problem.  
Them: I have a not to write. Haven't I tried any of those emails? Actually. But. Yeah, usually it'll just be times or something. Yeah. Or honestly, if someone responds, I try to just call them right away. And lock it in.  
Me: Would you consider. This.  
Them: Extending a video. Yeah.  
Me: You make one video once. Linked on the metric site. And then. That's what human consent to them, if they ask for it.  
Them: Like a loom. We could. But then I think the problem was the whole. Link thing, right?  
Me: Yeah. It wouldn't. Be late in the email. It would. Be like the email would say. If you'd like, I can send you a video.  
Them: Oh, I see.  
Me: That. Would be a follow up. Maybe.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: So you'd say, like, the first email would have a lot of detail. The second email would say, You must be busy over there. I made this short video. Are you interested in if they were? And you send in the video. Again. I don't know what actually gets people to respond. I'm just trying to think about. How do we systematize success? And then just gradually improve and actually get there.  
Them: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, it's a good question. I mean, to be honest, I don't know what works anymore either. I feel like my whole understanding of this. Has been thrown upside down. That could be an interesting. I think that we could try. But I think you're. I think. You're. Yes.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: Well, yeah. I mean, it's right. At least getting something. That's what I'm saying. So. It's been so frustrating. At least if someone was telling me no, then at least you can be like, okay, well, maybe my email needs change. Or this or that one. And you're just hearing nothing back. You're just, like, running up against the wall. It's just like, what's the. Like, yeah, what am I doing, right? What am I wrong? You have no idea. It's just like. Right.  
Me: Okay? Okay, so what if. You sent me a list of a thousand contacts enriched. What if 250 of them got a certain type of prompt? 250. Got another 250. We only proceed with the one of the four. That's the best, right? 255. Like too small of a number. Even as I'm saying, and I'm thinking, God, we need a sample. Size. But. Something like that. Could get us started.  
Them: Then we can check them out. I mean, I think, like, making them shorter is going to be a great idea. That. That's going to be huge. I. I Andrew too, if we should stop listening to all these people talking about links. Like, I don't know. I just Andrew if, like, we should include the tracking links again so we have better data. If we should include, like, a booking link, which I always used to include, so people can just pick a time to call us, because I feel like that's a pretty standard thing. Again. A lot of Z knows, like, maybe it's not best practice, but I feel like it is standard. Right. I just. You know, it's like, are we. We going a little too crazy with the. Optimization of deliverability and and losing out on the getting meanings right. I don't know. What do you think? Let me remove everything I got. Still got 0 replies, so might as well put the things back in there. I guess.  
Me: Could we test that as well?  
Them: Yeah. Maybe we could.  
Me: What if we pick three tests? So let's think about what are the three things we can optimize right now. One is. What is. The linking. Links and emails. Okay? And then two. Is. The. Length. Or body. I think we both know it needs to be shorter, so if you maybe not test that at all.  
Them: Test it, make sure it's too long. That's my fault. It's way too long.  
Me: You test the subject lines themselves? Let's just say it's the identical email. But the subject line is different.  
Them: Okay. How do we test that, though? This isn't every email going to be customized.  
Me: Well, I mean, we'll have to generate the subject line and the email itself. Yes. The. Answer is yes. Every email will be customized. Unless we ought to go with a partial customization.  
Them: Or we could bucket them into different styles. Of subject lines. And emails, Something like that. Maybe. I don't know.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: Try to categorize.  
Me: Repair a subject line and an email together. Kind of like we are now. We're doing that right now. With the report and the subject line.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: If you pair those two together. And then how do we test those? Do you want to? Just have the AI select. An out. Reach. I should say select one through four. Automatically or once we're. Two versions, one and two automatically.  
Them: Let me just say two. Keep it simple. Four is, like, a lot.  
Me: Yeah. Okay? So the two versions. And then you want it to be the. Andrew email. Completely from scratch. Or do you think maybe, for example, the two sentences you have to close, are those working really well right now? And we want the same two sentences to close at the bottom, regardless of what's at the top.  
Them: Yeah, I think something like that's fine. We can even give it like a template. To work from. I just think that. Yeah, I just think when we tried to do the first time, it was a little bit broken. Not broken. It just wasn't. Didn't sound. It sounded like we copy and pasted something in. Like it didn't sound like someone wrote it, like it was cohesive. So I think having AI just have all the context and then like email instead of trying to.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Like, stuff it in. Maybe better.  
Me: Two versions of subject. Plus email. And. Then I think what I'm going to do here, if you don't mind. Is make a new doc. And then get your feedback. That. Has not two versions, but maybe we'll start with five, right? It's like, here's five different versions. What are our top two out of the five?  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Because I can just. Already I can imagine there's going to be a lot of optimization in this. And thinking about what the sentences should be. Are. You okay? With adding a PS at the bottom. I've heard that that helps as well.  
Them: I was seeing that. I don't know. I mean, hey, you know what? I'll be open minded about it. I feel like it can come off like a little corny, but. I think. I mean, we could try it. I mean, whatever we're doing now is not working, so I'm open to anything. I think, right?  
Me: Okay? O. Kay. Versions. Maybe. Is there anything. So like the examples that you sent me. Is there anything in here that. The sentences. You can see that needs to say no matter what. It's like this is the perfect. Sentence. Perfect way to close. Truly. You know better than Neon all this stuff.  
Them: I feel like I don't know. Let's just try and see what the AI can come up with. I mean. Oh, one thing I do like, though. I do like. This is this personal thing. I do like having some bullet points for Built to read quickly. Which is kind of why I include those. So, I mean, that can maybe be something to keep. In addition to being shorter in general, but.  
Me: Yes. What if it was like. Okay, so it says typical projects include H vac photos and tillers. W nation lighting. Can you do it like that? Like it's just like a one word kind of explanation. Instead of okay.  
Them: Sure.  
Me: Swee. T.  
Them: And that's fine. Yeah, but I think you're. I think you make a great point, though, around optimizing for, like, readability and speed.  
Me: If there is any way to explain that truth. I think part of the recommendation. Said. Don't, don. 't talk about yourself. Right. Part of the recommendation. That email that I sent over was like, go talk to yourself. But is there a way that we can show what metrics doesn't say, hey, like, I work with, you know? Other hospitals. Because. What would it say we work with you? We work with all skills to achieve donations very best efficiency and sustainability budgets or something. We're like the lowest. Sustainability. Costs. Possible in the open market or like, I don't know what it would be. That's not.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: False marketing, but it's true. But it's bragging a little bit.  
Them: Yeah. So, like, I. I think that, like, so I think I agree generally with the idea of, like, don't talk about yourself because no one really cares, but I think you do need to, like, at least tell somebody a little bit about what you do. Like, like, what. What do you do? Who are you? Right. Like, answering that question. You don't need to go into whole lot because some people, especially on calls like, they love to talk about their own company because they're familiar with it. It's easy. But it's not really adding value. For the. For the client. Right. But, like a line or two. Just establish some credibility in who you are. I think, you know, is not a bad, not a bad thing. Like, I think even if you could put, like, since 2009, you know, metas has funded, implemented, and operated energy efficiency and blah, blah, blah solutions across hospitals and commercial industrial sites all across the United States. Something like that. So it tells you the year we found it, which gives some credibility the geographical areas we work and give us some credibility. Technically, we did fund something at a hospital, so it's true. Right.  
Me: Cool.  
Them: Maybe something like that.  
Me: Yeah. By the way. This is medium Transcript. So I'm going to. Take literally our conversation as well and paste that into the chat. And build. Some prompts. From it. So see what we can do.  
Them: Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, I think that'd be good. Makes it easier.  
Me: Yeah. Yeah. Exactly. What I mean to say is, like, verbatim from 2009 on could definitely work in that.  
Them: Yeah. You know what I'm saying, right? Like, that sound too, like. I don't know, I mean, maybe it's a bit cheesy, I don't know, but.  
Me: Yeah. What if we said something like, since 2009, Our company. Has helped. X number. Download that number is. Do you have a number of clients? Like.  
Them: I don't think so. Yeah.  
Me: We can say we've helped. X number of.  
Them: You know where it is? Hold on.  
Me: Companies.  
Them: It's in our. Hold on. Let me see.  
Me: 900 retrofitted.  
Them: There you go. Nearly a thousand. That's what I heard.  
Me: Yeah. Let's do that. From 2009, you've helped nearly 1000.  
Them: Yeah, I'm just pulling up. Our if you want some more ideas.  
Me: And. Saved. Yeah, this is the image. The equivalent of 13 million trees. That's awesome.  
Them: Yeah. Yeah. Have you seen here? This is like our little presentation we give people.  
Me: Can you screenshot that or show that presentation? To me.  
Them: Yeah. I'll just send you a presentation.  
Me: Okay? And then. I know we haven't talked about this. Yet. I know this is probably like a later stage goal, but the LinkedIn stuff. Have you explored any tools automation to that yet?  
Them: I Andrew if LinkedIn. Like we'll even really let you do too much. Because I feel like they want you to buy their tools.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: So I imagine. Yeah. Which I have, by the way, ourselves. Navigator.  
Me: Sales now together.  
Them: Now. Which I was using. It's not bad, but I really got many replies on it, and it's pretty limited, like 50amonth. Like that. 's. That's pretty small. You know, that's pretty small.  
Me: To be a sales platform. Like I think it's hard. The consumer to feel like it's a jobs platform. And they want the salespeople to feel like it's a sales platform, but they don't really want either to be perfectly connected.  
Them: Yeah, because then it becomes too annoying, right? Don't want to be harassed all day. I get it.  
Me: And I get so many messages. Like, my LinkedIn just looks like a long list of messages that I don't respond to.  
Them: Where do you find your clients?  
Me: That's a great question. I mean, now. It's primarily. Referrals, word of mouth.  
Them: Right.  
Me: Even the presentations that I do is primarily like, Somebody. Is hosting the things in industry reaches out. I do a little bit of. Like cold outreach. You can still call it still. And a little bit of. Cold prospecting on LinkedIn. When I'm sending messages, first I connect with people with no message. Then I send them a message that says, like, hey, I saw that you do X, Y or Z. And trying to explore this as an opportunity, would you be interested in sharing some more? I do a little bit of that. But. Everything that I do. If I'm honest, it just feels too salesy. I'm still trying to figure out what feels like the right amount of. Sal. Es.  
Them: Yeah. Yeah, it's interesting. Because, like, consulting, basically what you're selling.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: It's a bit harder than just, like, knock. Yeah.  
Me: What the label when people already have the clear problem. Not when you're just saying, hey. I could do this thing for you. Are you interested? So that the best things that have happened have been. Like Ben was intent on the sales duck before we ever even. Spoke.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: And. What happened there. I was the person that knows how to do this. I think. If I had just reached out to Ben out of the blue and said, like, hey, do you want an agent? He probably would have. Just had interest. Right.  
Them: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, it's cool.  
Me: Is there a signal? I could. Hunt for for you as well. That zoom info is grabbing of like a prospect. On the Internet. They're interested in this because. I don't know what the timing would be because they just followed, like, an H vac till three. That's a competitor or something.  
Them: Well, we have, like, an intent tracker on Zoom.  
Me: Yeah. Is that okay?  
Them: Yeah. Should be working. One topic like energy power, energy efficiency. Like I can see that people are searching this. Like I'm looking at it right now. It just. The problem is that. It's just not really like. Actually, let me look at this. It's just garbage. Results, though. Like 32, 000 results. You know, it's like, what is this? Everyone that's ever Googled energy efficiency in the last month.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Like, I don't know. Like, who are these companies? And now one company here is, like, one that I actually like I've ever heard of before.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: At all. Like, I mean, maybe delaware state university. I guess. Doesn't even tell me anything. Just says, Apparently they have 100 a score, like super hot. Interesting energy efficiency, but it gives you no information.  
Me: It's hard to say what that means to I'm reading here online. Sometimes the intent term is critical. Considering what they might be searching for, that would come up under a term question. Because I Andrew if they're searching for energy efficiency, could it be that. They personally are curious about sustainability, jobs or something, but not that. They're. A potential buyer of an energy efficiency solution.  
Them: Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, totally. Yeah. I mean, I don't know. There's some interesting ones here. Jaldwin. That'd be a cool one. Maybe I'll take a look at this. I don't know. I guess it's better than doing nothing, but.  
Me: Okay, well, let me know.  
Them: Because it's.  
Me: How soon can I get this to you? I mean. Do you want? Some email versions right away. Oh, the other thing I didn't show you, but I have a new list of 58 contacts, and then I'm working on.  
Them: Yes.  
Me: The contacts from the new data sources, new data provider, that employee from. That's great. We also have our original, which is searching on Google, and we still have the info. It's between the three. We should be able to get a really comprehensive view of anybody who might work at a company.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: And getting back to the way to move forward and get to that. You want to get 6,000 emails, let's get some more people in there. Maybe my plan will be to start coming on and running. Sort of lead contact enrichment process. And then put that into the dashboard that I showed you. If you have the Facebook, watch that email. That video that I sent.  
Them: Sorry. Lucas, I apologize.  
Me: So essentially, I've just given you this dashboard online that allows for you, if you want to, to go and click in and. See? Updates or make your own updates to Salesforce or an account or contact.  
Them: Oh, nice. Okay. Oh, sorry. I didn't look at this. I didn't know how to use it, but I did look at it. Yeah. Yeah. Okay.  
Me: Well, let me know. Let me know if I can. You know, we can all do another call and we could show you more details about what I was thinking that could work for, but essentially. Imagine that I could actually have the contacts just kind of imported into that, then. And new contact. You could just go through and you could check. Yes, if they look good.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: And then those could be added automatically to that retrieve because they're just in contact ported into your sales hosting to your system.  
Them: Yeah. I'm just trying to look at where you sent this. Ramping out rage. Oh, yeah. Documento. Is that what it is? Oh, this is the contract. Never mind. How can we use documents so and not like DocuSign?  
Me: Like stories or subtitle documents. And I think DocuSign is. A little bit predatory.  
Them: Interesting.  
Me: And present. S. That I work with all these documents. So it's kind of the new alternative, I guess.  
Them: Oh, yolan, I got it here. Oh, I'll give me switch to this old timey text.  
Me: The old timey text.  
Them: Yeah. You want to see? Kind of funny.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: I thought you did this on purpose. It was, like, a quirky thing, but I Andrew now if it's just.  
Me: Yeah. What happened? Oh. No. That. Don't look. Right.  
Them: Oh, not yet.  
Me: Prevent. Every other email is normal.  
Them: Yeah, that switches back.  
Me: I'm sorry. I don't know what happened there.  
Them: Oh, I don't apologize. It was random. Yeah.  
Me: Yeah. So if you click on the five minute video tour, And. I don't want to force you to watch any more pressure at all. But essentially all this is showing you how it works. But the dashboard is designed to make it easier for you. If you, say, have an account and salesforce that you want to enrich tomorrow, Not necessarily have to ask me. I'm happy to go do it for you. But you could just paste in the link to that account on Salesforce and then click Enrich from the dashboard. We'll go back for you. And then you have to prove it. You click agree checkmark to approve did it look good? And then it'll update the salesforce.  
Them: Oh, no, that's. That's fantastic. We should definitely do that. It just. It's annoying to bother.  
Me: Yeah. If. You click Enrichment Dashboard. Okay. And then you can go literally there. Yeah. You can click the written an account over to Contact. That'll do the full thing. Right. Including financial data, for example, will include kind of that key information. About the company the way the average cost of capital. The moody data. Stuff you can do a.  
Them: Yes.  
Me: Bulk request. You can make a list of account. Id. And then if you scroll down, you can even look up credit for a company, maybe more useful. For Boston or something than you.  
Them: Yes. Oh, wow. Okay.  
Me: Have. That's kind of the basic idea. And then if you go back to the homepage super quick, Wanted to call out. That when. You enrich here. When it finishes, it gets added to this pending Salesforce update section. So it's not going to update the Salesforce automatically. That's intentional, right? Human Maloop. Cut it and you make sure there's no errors before you actually move it to Salesforce, just in case. It grabbed the wrong account or it doesn't look right. You can just kind of check there first and click the green checkmark when it's good.  
Them: Cool. Nice. And for this enrichment dashboard. If I put in, like, a. Like an account, does it also do all the contacts on that account, or do I have to do them separately?  
Me: That's a separate process. So I haven't done that yet because right now, that process is super long. If you think about how long it takes to Google search for a given name and then to do that. For 100 times. It just takes forever.  
Them: Yeah, yeah.  
Me: And so I could work on getting that added. Actually, the way I think it would work better is if you go back to the home page. Imagine for a second you'll sleep. And the system is running automatically while you're sleeping. You wake up in the morning and there's just a long list here depending update section.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Of new contacts to be added. Then you just go through that list and you go like, yes, that looks like a good contact. Certified financial, whatever it is, and I can just click back.  
Them: Y. Es. Yeah. This is amazing. This is so cool.  
Me: Okay? And it doesn't have to be, by the way. It's something I worked up over the weekend that I was taking recursive to have a little more visibility into what's happening.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: If you're super curious, you can see the request logs there. If you click on the logs and the documentation. That pretty much everything that's been coded, so that's. Going to be just a lot more detail for you about what's happening.  
Them: Yeah. This is great. This is a project going to resell to other companies.  
Me: Haven't gotten there yet. I don't think so. But I don't know. You tell me if you think it could.  
Them: Pretty cool.  
Me: Be finding prospects or something might be valuable.  
Them: Well, if you look at how much like, Clay charges for this, right?  
Me: Right.  
Them: Like, how much are they charged? 5, 600amonth?  
Me: I think they make a mistake by making everyone do it themselves. Right. I felt it could be more biased. About what ways to grab information.  
Them: Yeah. See, it's pretty expensive. And then obviously they do all this other nonsense too, right? Everybody wants to be a CRM, but. Anyways. Yeah. If you ever wanted to compare.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Yeah, very cool.  
Me: Oh, my goodness. Okay? They said you end up taking a lot of your time. Anything else? To read.  
Them: No, no, I think we're good. This is very, very productive. Yeah. Let me know if you need any help with those emails. I mean, I can send you over some examples of one that been sending if you want to. I'll look around and shoot a couple over and. You can use that as inspiration. But. But I. I really think that, like, you're on the right track, maybe better than I was. In terms of the length. And the punchiness of it. I think that's a big. That's a big thing. And taught. Even just talking to you about it's been helpful. Let's be honest, like. Ben's been super busy. Like, I talked to him for, like, 30 minutes a week. Sometimes.  
Me: Yeah, last week.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: He sent me the nobody's like, hey, can we meet? Give me three available slots. I guess part time. Like all of those are booked. Can you do this time? This time? Because I send them like a big swap of other availability. There's no response.  
Them: Y. Eah. He's on a flight right now, too. He's going to Seattle or something. Like, he's. He's, like, never home anymore.  
Me: Oh, my goodness.  
Them: So. It's funny. In our last job, he used to complain we never got to travel. And now he's, like, never home, so. Come, come. Full circle.  
Me: The pendulum. Yeah.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: Oh, my goodness.  
Them: So anyways. So, yeah, it's just good someone's talk to someone else about it and. Yeah. We'll see. Anyways.  
Me: What are you. Are you taking off of Thanksgiving? Too.  
Them: I don't have Thanksgiving. Only americans do. Big canadian thanksgiving. Already. Sign here.  
Me: I don't know why I didn't know that. It never occurred to me that Canada would have a different feeling about the Mayflower. That's so funny to me.  
Them: It's funny, though, because it's the same holiday.  
Me: Is it not the same group of people that just, like, immigrated a little further north, or am I missing something? I guess it's strategy involved.  
Them: No. That's crazy. French, but I mean, it's not like that different. Like, it's, the food is the same, the stories sort of the same. Like, it's not, it's just on a different day. I actually, I, I, I searched it up once. There's not really like a. Like a reason why. I don't know. Anyways, it just creates this funny thing where, like, I now have to work by myself. For a couple days.  
Me: In Metriss is taking off.  
Them: Yeah. I mean, I guess technically, I could have some lazy days, but, like, I. I don't know, it just kind of weird because no one. Like, no one I know is. Is off. Everyone else working. My family's all working, my friends all working. Like, it's not like someone's going to randomly take off a Thursday Friday. So.  
Me: We said quick pieces. File this in the back of my mind as a reason why we might be failing the next couple of months. Is people taking off for Christmas and for Thanksgiving. This whole next couple of months, people will be gone for no reason other than they took two weeks with family.  
Them: Yeah. 100. There's. There's totally seasonality with this. So, yeah, Thanksgiving is a big one. That week before. In the short term, Christmas holidays until January, it's going to be pretty bad. Summer is also a little slow, too. People take a lot of time off, especially near the end of summer. For the july time. You know, spring break. Two, three weeks. Around there, people take time. So. But the holidays for sure is bad. I mean, that's kind of why Ben has been stressing out, because our deal cycle is a year long. Right. So if a meeting we said in September, right? That might close in September. So the next year or so, if you think about it, we're almost booking meetings for 2027 closes.  
Me: Go down like you want it to be, always ticking upwards.  
Them: Yeah. Yeah. So that's why he's also, like. That's where the pressure is coming from. He's planning to add a little bit. And then with hospitals, who knows? It couldn't be longer.  
Me: Okay?  
Them: Right. The bigger the project, obviously, the more complex, the longer it might take.  
Me: Do you? I know. We're tracking this election. With like non hospitals only, but higher ed as well. At what point should I start, you know, focusing in on higher ed?  
Them: I'm not sure. I don't know. That's got to be Ben's call. Like I was a. I was working with bob on some. Some cni stuff, too. Because I think just my personal opinion, not opinion of metros. Ben makes the decision, but the issue I'm worrying we're going to run into is we're in these hospitals, which are great in terms of like big long term projects, but the problems are very big and complex. And there's not a lot of low hanging opportunities. So. Bob and I were kind of. Or I was thinking about reaching out to more commercial customers because, like, at least there's maybe some, like, easy projects you might be able to look at. So then you kind of have a bit of a balanced pipeline. Leaves the big ones are working on, but also in smaller ones with a short term. So just in case one of those big ones fails. You have some cushion instead of being like, oh, my God, I can have to wait another six months to find out what the next opportunity, where it goes, right? I don't know.  
Me: 01. Okay?  
Them: Man. I see what ben thinks. I mean.  
Me: I'm going to. I know he wants to be included in all this, too, so I might just send him an email. After this, if you think appropriate. Andrew and I just met. Here's a quick recap. Just sticking in the loop. We're developing new. Email templates.  
Them: Yeah. Maybe don't bring up the scene, I think yet, though. Just focus it on that and then we can figure that out later. Because I know Ben wants. Then Ben is right to want to focus on the. Other stuff, so.  
Me: Cool. Okay? Well, thank you so much.  
Them: Yeah. No, thank you.  
Me: Okay, I'll begin soon. Also, you need more for sure. Like. By Monday or Tuesday. So we can keep track on this. Okay?  
Them: One last thing before you go, Lucas. When is Thanksgiving? Next Thursday. Friday. Right.  
Me: Y. Eah.  
Them: Okay, cool.  
Me: I just have a long weekend. For me, it'll be like a Friday to Monday story. Not a long trip or something.  
Them: Okay. Okay, cool. Hey, are you going to be in California? At first we get December at all?  
Me: I will be. Not for the year, it'll be. For end of December. Like poor Christmas time frame. I'm not sure if that. 's part of your story. Too.  
Them: Oh, no. Okay. I was just wondering. Yeah, we're having our mattress Christmas party in the first to the fifth. Like that week we're all going to be in the office, so I just Andrew if you were around at all.  
Me: That would be cool.  
Them: Yeah.  
Me: I think I should make a point. Maybe we can keep in touch the next time that you go out there. I should make a point to try to see you guys and stop by the office.  
Them: Yeah. Yeah, if you're in town. I mean, whatever. You don't have to. I know it's far for you, so.  
Me: Yeah.  
Them: Don't come out just for no reason, but.  
Me: I. Could come out just for, you know, Silicon Valley. It's a fun place to hang out.  
Them: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm sure you have an excuse. It's a business expense. You're meeting. Meeting some client or something. Have some fun.  
Me: Yeah. Y. Eah. Andrew. Talk to you later.  
Them: Yeah. I say to bite.
