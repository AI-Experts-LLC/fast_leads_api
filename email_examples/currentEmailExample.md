Hey Rodney,

 

Just tried giving you a quick call — figured it might be easier to chat live.

 

Any chance you’ve got a few minutes to connect sometime soon?

 

Best,

Hi Rodney,

 

I came across your work leading Facilities Operations and Engineering at HCA Healthcare in Aurora — sounds like you’ve got a lot on your plate keeping systems reliable and efficient across such a complex environment. With HCA’s continued focus on infrastructure upgrades and tightening capital budgets, I thought this might be timely to share.

 

Facilities and maintenance teams are under constant pressure to keep systems running safely and efficiently while managing aging infrastructure and limited budgets. Metrus Energy helps by funding and delivering energy and infrastructure upgrades with no upfront cost through our Energy-as-a-Service model.

 

We handle chillers, boilers, HVAC, lighting, controls, and backup power — managing design, installation, and maintenance.

 

Why teams choose Metrus:

Reduces downtime and maintenance workload
Improves energy efficiency and compliance
Enhances reliability without capital expense
Would it make sense to explore how this could support HCA Healthcare’s facility performance and environmental goals?

 

Best,
