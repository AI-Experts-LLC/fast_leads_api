While Brinder did not report to me directly, we had many occasions to work closely and I had ample opportunity to judge his work and work ethic. I recall that Brinder was, indeed, gifted. He is articulate and persuasive, as well as very, very smart, resourceful, and ethical.  Moreover, Brinder is extremely likable and personable. Such qualities bode well for a future manager and executive leader. Beyond his ever-present \"yes\" attitude to work, work and more work, Brinder was always the one to offer to help his teammates problem solve, to provide additional analysis or even just a quick smile of encouragement to harried colleagues. It is no surprise to me that Brinder Singh has become so successful so early on in his career. I have no doubt, whatsoever, that his career trajectory will continue to impress.  I recommend Brinder enthuiastically, without reservation."

While Brinder did not report to me directly, we had many occasions to work closely and I had ample opportunity to judge his work and work ethic. I recall that Brinder was, indeed, gifted. He is articulate and persuasive, as well as very, very smart, resourceful, and ethical.  Moreover, Brinder is extremely likable and personable. Such qualities bode well for a future manager and executive leader. Beyond his ever-present \"yes\" attitude to work, work and more work, Brinder was always the one to offer to help his teammates problem solve, to provide additional analysis or even just a quick smile of encouragement to harried colleagues. It is no surprise to me that Brinder Singh has become so successful so early on in his career. I have no doubt, whatsoever, that his career trajectory will continue to impress.  I recommend Brinder enthuiastically, without reservation."

As a young graduate student you often don\u2019t know which door to knock on. You aren\u2019t familiar with the opportunities out there nor do you really have any connections. I could always knock on Ellen\u2019s door! Ellen created opportunities for me, recognized my strengths and abilities and set me up for success. I have always admired her dedication, ability to lead others as well as her commitment to healthcare excellence. She is remarkably insightful, a visionary who is always promoting positive change with results. Ellen was always there for me as a graduate student and continues to be there for me today. I recommend Ellen without reservation as a leader, a colleague, and a mentor.\u201d  Good Luck Ellen! Brinder Singh"

I manage site financials and budgeting processes for this high-volume facility with over 700 daily patient visits, while fostering a cooperative work environment by liaising with service line managers and mentoring emerging leaders and staff. My overall aim is to position Lafayette as a premier workplace by actively engaging in multidisciplinary meetings and partnering with leaders from other locations.\n\nSome of my key contributions include:\n\u2022 Partnered with other leaders to successfully open a new clinic floor, boosting patient volume by 10%.\n\u2022 Streamlined the check-in process by integrating Tonic and Intake Automation software, allowing for a 50% increase in patient volume without the need for additional staff.\n\u2022 Recruited skilled team leaders and provided ongoing training for front-desk staff, reducing errors in verifying patient eligibility and capturing demographic information by 30%.\n\u2022 Meticulously manage an annual budget of $2M, closely monitoring expenditure and implementing processes to improve cost control.\n\u2022 Built strong relationships with various vendors, significantly saving on the cost of hospital consumables and pharmaceuticals by negotiating best prices and favorable contract terms.\n\u2022 Spearheaded initiatives to foster collaboration across various service lines by implementing monthly touchpoint meetings, improving communication and operational efficiency, which led to the adoption of this process by other Multi Ambulatory Care Centers (MACC).\n\u2022 Developed and maintained an efficient posting process, establishing it as the gold standard for ambulatory surgical centers within the group, which was later adopted by other MACC sites."
