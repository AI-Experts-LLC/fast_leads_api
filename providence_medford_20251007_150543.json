Darren supported equipment repairs, tracking/metrics, and the injury prevention program.

Brian brings multiple skills to the table and is able to manage complex multiphase projects with various contracting styles (IPD, GMP, Lump Sum, Lean IPD, Design/Build ). Brian also effectively managed and maintained the project budget, he communicated all potential issues to the team and kept everyone actively engaged in creative problem solving. If our healthcare system ever looked to build any large design build campus I would request we engage Brian and his team as their skill set has proven to be second to none."

Achieving the highest levels of performance starts with design of products and systems, integrating the contributions of a complex network of suppliers, and coordinating production according to key constraints throughout the supply chain. Finally, the most effective route to achieving continuous improvement in this environment is the integrated application of Lean, Six Sigma, and Theory of Constraints."

He has an extensive background in acute care hospital construction and understands clinical needs that impact design and construction.

He led our group through some difficult decisions and always put the patients and employee safety first. We saw situations where caregivers were being injured during patient lifting scenarios. Darren supported equipment repairs, tracking/metrics, and the injury prevention program. Darren could be seen fostering connections throughout the day with patients and caregivers on a personal level and he genuinely cares for those around him.  He has strong core values and leadership skills that are exemplary. I highly recommend Darren, he is a highly motivated, action-oriented, results driven leader."

Brian worked with us on several large initiatives including a large Teaching-Health Clinic and a ground-up 100 bed inpatient behavioral health hospital. Brian brings multiple skills to the table and is able to manage complex multiphase projects with various contracting styles (IPD, GMP, Lump Sum, Lean IPD, Design/Build ). Brian also effectively managed and maintained the project budget, he communicated all potential issues to the team and kept everyone actively engaged in creative problem solving. If our healthcare system ever looked to build any large design build campus I would request we engage Brian and his team as their skill set has proven to be second to none."

Darren supported equipment repairs, tracking/metrics, and the injury prevention program.

Brian brings multiple skills to the table and is able to manage complex multiphase projects with various contracting styles (IPD, GMP, Lump Sum, Lean IPD, Design/Build ). Brian also effectively managed and maintained the project budget, he communicated all potential issues to the team and kept everyone actively engaged in creative problem solving.

While many courses in manufacturing focus on the mechanical operations and processes, this certificate focuses on maximizing the performance of the entire system. Achieving the highest levels of performance starts with design of products and systems, integrating the contributions of a complex network of suppliers, and coordinating production according to key constraints throughout the supply chain. Finally, the most effective route to achieving continuous improvement in this environment is the integrated application of Lean, Six Sigma, and Theory of Constraints."

Darren supported equipment repairs, tracking/metrics, and the injury prevention program. Darren could be seen fostering connections throughout the day with patients and caregivers on a personal level and he genuinely cares for those around him.  He has strong core values and leadership skills that are exemplary. I highly recommend Darren, he is a highly motivated, action-oriented, results driven leader."

He has exemplary leadership skills and is able to forecast both the owners needs and all of the trade partners needs in parallel. Brian worked with us on several large initiatives including a large Teaching-Health Clinic and a ground-up 100 bed inpatient behavioral health hospital. Brian brings multiple skills to the table and is able to manage complex multiphase projects with various contracting styles (IPD, GMP, Lump Sum, Lean IPD, Design/Build ). Brian also effectively managed and maintained the project budget, he communicated all potential issues to the team and kept everyone actively engaged in creative problem solving. If our healthcare system ever looked to build any large design build campus I would request we engage Brian and his team as their skill set has proven to be second to none."

There were several tasks we requested of him and his team which included validation of hardware deployment and configuration and testing of all workstations. During the main event for testing Johnny and his team Johnny and his team did a great job working around patient care and caregivers as this was a production environment in an active hospital.

The clinical environment takes compassion and empathy; both of which Alvin displays. \n\nOther key skills would be his ability to develop relationships and trust with the key stakeholders and team members.

There were several tasks we requested of him and his team which included validation of hardware deployment and configuration and testing of all workstations. During the main event for testing Johnny and his team Johnny and his team did a great job working around patient care and caregivers as this was a production environment in an active hospital. His demeanor with peers and colleagues was exemplary and if we had an opening on our team, I am confident we would have gladly recruited him to work for us. His clinical experience and understanding of technology is very helpful when bridging the gap for customers."

My direct reports interacted with Alvin daily and I served as an escalation point for the holistic project.\n\nAlvin is professional, accountable, and possesses a passion for the details and customer satisfaction. In his role as an IS Project Manager he was responsible to attend and report out progress and barriers daily, communicate directly with the clinical caregivers when scheduling and entering their workspace. The clinical environment takes compassion and empathy; both of which Alvin displays. \n\nOther key skills would be his ability to develop relationships and trust with the key stakeholders and team members. This was accomplished by being accountable, knowledgeable, flexible, and approachable. Any organization would be lucky to have him."

I have had the pleasure of working with Jamie as a coworker, direct report, and in his previous roles as Chief Technical Officer and Strategic Partner.\n\nI worked directly for Jamie when he was the Director of IT at Medford Medical Clinic. As the director, Jamie initiated and led several infrastructure improvements including deploying virtual servers, wireless infrastructure, and Microsoft and Apple Software servers. Jamie also initiated and led meetings with with his peers at other companies to share ideas and strategies to improve services to stakeholders. Jamie cares about his employees and worked tirelessly to make sure we had the training and resources to accomplish our mission.\n\nAs a strategic partner, Jamie is excellent at working to build teams to resolve issues that arise. Hospital executives know that they can bring issues to him and he will build the team and gather resources necessary to resolve their issues quickly. Jamie cares deeply about making sure that our IT systems work and that any problems are quickly resolved. Jamie and I often picked each other's brains for ideas and solutions while he was the Chief Technology Officer at Providence University.\n\nJamie will be a great asset for the company fortunate enough to hire him. Wherever he lands, I would be the first in line to apply to work on his team if we still worked in the same area. I know that he will work to make his organization the best that it can be and those fortunate enough to work for him will be challenged to be their best."

Russ is highly driven to be a life long learner and is always willing to share his knowledge with those around him. I first met Russ in 2008 while working together in tech repair. In light of a poor work environment we always challenged each other to do our best. Russ not only lead the company in repairs but did so well he was honored by Apple as a top Apple tech. Not an easy achievement.\nYears later, after both advancing in our career's I had the opportunity to hire Russ at Medford Medical Clinic and jumped on it right away. This was one of the best decisions I've made in my leadership career thus far. Not only did Russ bring a vast amount of experience but he came with his drive to always improve. Russ's drive created a force within our department and we became one of the top IT offices in our region.\n\nTo date, the only regret I have regarding Russ is that I moved out of state and couldn't take him with.

I have had the pleasure of working with Jamie as a coworker, direct report, and in his previous roles as Chief Technical Officer and Strategic Partner.\n\nI worked directly for Jamie when he was the Director of IT at Medford Medical Clinic. As the director, Jamie initiated and led several infrastructure improvements including deploying virtual servers, wireless infrastructure, and Microsoft and Apple Software servers. Jamie also initiated and led meetings with with his peers at other companies to share ideas and strategies to improve services to stakeholders. Jamie cares about his employees and worked tirelessly to make sure we had the training and resources to accomplish our mission.\n\nAs a strategic partner, Jamie is excellent at working to build teams to resolve issues that arise. Hospital executives know that they can bring issues to him and he will build the team and gather resources necessary to resolve their issues quickly. Jamie cares deeply about making sure that our IT systems work and that any problems are quickly resolved. Jamie and I often picked each other's brains for ideas and solutions while he was the Chief Technology Officer at Providence University.\n\nJamie will be a great asset for the company fortunate enough to hire him. Wherever he lands, I would be the first in line to apply to work on his team if we still worked in the same area. I know that he will work to make his organization the best that it can be and those fortunate enough to work for him will be challenged to be their best."

Russ is highly driven to be a life long learner and is always willing to share his knowledge with those around him. I first met Russ in 2008 while working together in tech repair. In light of a poor work environment we always challenged each other to do our best. Russ not only lead the company in repairs but did so well he was honored by Apple as a top Apple tech. Not an easy achievement.\nYears later, after both advancing in our career's I had the opportunity to hire Russ at Medford Medical Clinic and jumped on it right away. This was one of the best decisions I've made in my leadership career thus far. Not only did Russ bring a vast amount of experience but he came with his drive to always improve. Russ's drive created a force within our department and we became one of the top IT offices in our region.\n\nTo date, the only regret I have regarding Russ is that I moved out of state and couldn't take him with.

In his role as an IS Project Manager he was responsible to attend and report out progress and barriers daily, communicate directly with the clinical caregivers when scheduling and entering their workspace. The clinical environment takes compassion and empathy; both of which Alvin displays. \n\nOther key skills would be his ability to develop relationships and trust with the key stakeholders and team members.

Once Epic was fully deployed and had gone live at the hospital work transitioned to managing other projects that included equipping and preparing several new clinics and departments with technology and the Epic EMR. Eventually the experience gained was deemed valuable and was requested to travel and train other Providence desktop teams for deployments of Epic in Walla Walla and Spokane.

There were several tasks we requested of him and his team which included validation of hardware deployment and configuration and testing of all workstations. During the main event for testing Johnny and his team Johnny and his team did a great job working around patient care and caregivers as this was a production environment in an active hospital. His demeanor with peers and colleagues was exemplary and if we had an opening on our team, I am confident we would have gladly recruited him to work for us. His clinical experience and understanding of technology is very helpful when bridging the gap for customers."

During the time we worked together my role was a Principal Project Manager and later a Senior Manager of a team that was heavily involved with the implementation of the Epic electronic medical record for Covenant Health in Texas and New Mexico. My direct reports interacted with Alvin daily and I served as an escalation point for the holistic project.\n\nAlvin is professional, accountable, and possesses a passion for the details and customer satisfaction. In his role as an IS Project Manager he was responsible to attend and report out progress and barriers daily, communicate directly with the clinical caregivers when scheduling and entering their workspace. The clinical environment takes compassion and empathy; both of which Alvin displays. \n\nOther key skills would be his ability to develop relationships and trust with the key stakeholders and team members. This was accomplished by being accountable, knowledgeable, flexible, and approachable. Any organization would be lucky to have him."

My broad IT background has allowed me to experience many different types of IT services from Tier 1 Call centers to Managing large Healthcare IT environments across multiple sites.  As a manager of IT operations for multiple healthcare sites I still like to get my hands dirty helping others with their IT related questions or needs. I am an avid computer user outside of work and love streaming, Gaming E-Sports, pop culture and 3-D printing.  \n\nThe last 3 years my role has evolved in to one of transformation as we transform the IT environment into a highly reliable, sustainable and compliant Enterprise IT vision.  Moving from IT Admin to IT Supervisor and now an IT manager of multiple Enterprise Healthcare locations.  I am excited to see what the future of computing will bring to the table.",

I have had the pleasure of working with Jamie as a coworker, direct report, and in his previous roles as Chief Technical Officer and Strategic Partner.\n\nI worked directly for Jamie when he was the Director of IT at Medford Medical Clinic. As the director, Jamie initiated and led several infrastructure improvements including deploying virtual servers, wireless infrastructure, and Microsoft and Apple Software servers. Jamie also initiated and led meetings with with his peers at other companies to share ideas and strategies to improve services to stakeholders. Jamie cares about his employees and worked tirelessly to make sure we had the training and resources to accomplish our mission.\n\nAs a strategic partner, Jamie is excellent at working to build teams to resolve issues that arise. Hospital executives know that they can bring issues to him and he will build the team and gather resources necessary to resolve their issues quickly. Jamie cares deeply about making sure that our IT systems work and that any problems are quickly resolved. Jamie and I often picked each other's brains for ideas and solutions while he was the Chief Technology Officer at Providence University.\n\nJamie will be a great asset for the company fortunate enough to hire him. Wherever he lands, I would be the first in line to apply to work on his team if we still worked in the same area. I know that he will work to make his organization the best that it can be and those fortunate enough to work for him will be challenged to be their best."

Russ is highly driven to be a life long learner and is always willing to share his knowledge with those around him. I first met Russ in 2008 while working together in tech repair. In light of a poor work environment we always challenged each other to do our best. Russ not only lead the company in repairs but did so well he was honored by Apple as a top Apple tech. Not an easy achievement.\nYears later, after both advancing in our career's I had the opportunity to hire Russ at Medford Medical Clinic and jumped on it right away. This was one of the best decisions I've made in my leadership career thus far. Not only did Russ bring a vast amount of experience but he came with his drive to always improve. Russ's drive created a force within our department and we became one of the top IT offices in our region.\n\nTo date, the only regret I have regarding Russ is that I moved out of state and couldn't take him with.

I have had the pleasure of working with Jamie as a coworker, direct report, and in his previous roles as Chief Technical Officer and Strategic Partner.\n\nI worked directly for Jamie when he was the Director of IT at Medford Medical Clinic. As the director, Jamie initiated and led several infrastructure improvements including deploying virtual servers, wireless infrastructure, and Microsoft and Apple Software servers. Jamie also initiated and led meetings with with his peers at other companies to share ideas and strategies to improve services to stakeholders. Jamie cares about his employees and worked tirelessly to make sure we had the training and resources to accomplish our mission.\n\nAs a strategic partner, Jamie is excellent at working to build teams to resolve issues that arise. Hospital executives know that they can bring issues to him and he will build the team and gather resources necessary to resolve their issues quickly. Jamie cares deeply about making sure that our IT systems work and that any problems are quickly resolved. Jamie and I often picked each other's brains for ideas and solutions while he was the Chief Technology Officer at Providence University.\n\nJamie will be a great asset for the company fortunate enough to hire him. Wherever he lands, I would be the first in line to apply to work on his team if we still worked in the same area. I know that he will work to make his organization the best that it can be and those fortunate enough to work for him will be challenged to be their best."

Russ is highly driven to be a life long learner and is always willing to share his knowledge with those around him. I first met Russ in 2008 while working together in tech repair. In light of a poor work environment we always challenged each other to do our best. Russ not only lead the company in repairs but did so well he was honored by Apple as a top Apple tech. Not an easy achievement.\nYears later, after both advancing in our career's I had the opportunity to hire Russ at Medford Medical Clinic and jumped on it right away. This was one of the best decisions I've made in my leadership career thus far. Not only did Russ bring a vast amount of experience but he came with his drive to always improve. Russ's drive created a force within our department and we became one of the top IT offices in our region.\n\nTo date, the only regret I have regarding Russ is that I moved out of state and couldn't take him with.

Achieving the highest levels of performance starts with design of products and systems, integrating the contributions of a complex network of suppliers, and coordinating production according to key constraints throughout the supply chain. Finally, the most effective route to achieving continuous improvement in this environment is the integrated application of Lean, Six Sigma, and Theory of Constraints."

Darren is a champion of strong morals and ethics, combined with customer service. As such, he was always promoting our team of managers to do the right thing. He led our group through some difficult decisions and always put the patients and employee safety first. We saw situations where caregivers were being injured during patient lifting scenarios. Darren supported equipment repairs, tracking/metrics, and the injury prevention program. Darren could be seen fostering connections throughout the day with patients and caregivers on a personal level and he genuinely cares for those around him.  He has strong core values and leadership skills that are exemplary. I highly recommend Darren, he is a highly motivated, action-oriented, results driven leader."

Brian brings multiple skills to the table and is able to manage complex multiphase projects with various contracting styles (IPD, GMP, Lump Sum, Lean IPD, Design/Build ). Brian also effectively managed and maintained the project budget, he communicated all potential issues to the team and kept everyone actively engaged in creative problem solving. If our healthcare system ever looked to build any large design build campus I would request we engage Brian and his team as their skill set has proven to be second to none."

While many courses in manufacturing focus on the mechanical operations and processes, this certificate focuses on maximizing the performance of the entire system. Achieving the highest levels of performance starts with design of products and systems, integrating the contributions of a complex network of suppliers, and coordinating production according to key constraints throughout the supply chain. Finally, the most effective route to achieving continuous improvement in this environment is the integrated application of Lean, Six Sigma, and Theory of Constraints."

Darren supported equipment repairs, tracking/metrics, and the injury prevention program. Darren could be seen fostering connections throughout the day with patients and caregivers on a personal level and he genuinely cares for those around him.

Brian brings multiple skills to the table and is able to manage complex multiphase projects with various contracting styles (IPD, GMP, Lump Sum, Lean IPD, Design/Build ). Brian also effectively managed and maintained the project budget, he communicated all potential issues to the team and kept everyone actively engaged in creative problem solving. If our healthcare system ever looked to build any large design build campus I would request we engage Brian and his team as their skill set has proven to be second to none."
