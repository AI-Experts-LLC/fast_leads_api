## üêõ Issues Identified

### 1. ‚úÖ FIXED: GPT-5 Temperature Parameter
**Error:** `Unsupported parameter: 'temperature' is not supported with this model`
**Fix:** Removed temperature parameter from Responses API calls
**Files:** `improved_prospect_discovery.py`, `improved_ai_ranking.py`

### 2. ‚úÖ FIXED: NoneType Response Handling
**Error:** `'NoneType' object is not subscriptable`
**Fix:** Added response validation before accessing response.output fields
**File:** `improved_prospect_discovery.py:915-929`

### 3. ‚ö†Ô∏è TO INVESTIGATE: AI Title Filter Count
**Issue:** Pipeline shows "0" after AI title filter, but 111 profiles still scraped
**Expected:** Should show actual count of prospects that passed title filter
**Impact:** Low (processing still works, just confusing metrics)

---

## üìù Key Observations

### ‚úÖ Strengths
1. **Company name expansion is excellent** - 27 variations captured many organizational units
2. **Director-level targeting working well** - All 8 prospects are director-level or above
3. **Location filtering accurate** - All prospects are in Billings, Montana
4. **AI scoring seems reasonable** - Foundation coordinator scored highest (has budget influence)
5. **Processing time acceptable** - ~8 minutes for comprehensive analysis

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Considerations
1. **Clinical directors dominating results** - Most prospects are clinical directors (cardiovascular, radiology, wound care) rather than facilities/operations directors
2. **No CFO/COO found** - Traditional finance/operations executives not identified
3. **Missing traditional target personas:**
   - Director of Facilities
   - Energy Manager
   - Sustainability Director
   - VP of Operations
   - CFO

### üí° Recommendations
1. **Adjust target title search** - May need to search more specifically for "facilities", "operations", "engineering" titles
2. **Review scoring criteria** - Consider whether clinical directors should score as highly as facilities/operations directors
3. **Investigate title filter metrics** - Fix the "0 after title filter" reporting issue
4. **Add fallback searches** - If no facilities directors found, broaden to related roles

---

## üéØ Next Steps

1. Test with another hospital to validate consistency
2. Fix the AI title filter count reporting
3. Review whether clinical directors are appropriate targets for energy infrastructure sales
4. Consider adjusting search queries to find more facilities/operations staff
5. Deploy fixes to Railway production environment
