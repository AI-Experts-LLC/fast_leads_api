Anyone looking for an industry resource for project specific services will find him a great investment with immediate, high impact payback.  Steve functions well in a team environment and has strong expertise merging financial and operational skills honed through years of strong experience allowing him to add value to any situation. His strong work ethic accomplishes the typical project ahead of schedule. Analytically, he's a brilliant talent capable of learning independently on the fly.  This quality is an extraordinarily rare advantage for a consultant in our industry, which is constantly evolving as numerous sub-fields interact. Steve rolls up his sleeves everyday and learns the latest techniques and industry rules, but I judge his strongest talent as his ability to picture an analysis and its variables in his mind before numerically painting them in exquisite, understandable detail.  Over and over again I have seen him create new financial models complex enough to take all essential variables into place, but simple to understand and use in effectively communicating with various constituents.  Several examples will suffice.  During our time working together for an IDS (\"Integrated Delivery System\") in the early to mid-1990's, Steve successfully developed complex financial models for all of the System's entities that spanned the continuum from physician clinics, reference laboratories and nursing homes, to HMOs and acute care hospitals. He demonstrated an ability to learn the specific characteristics of each of the healthcare entities' sub-market segments on the run and on an independent basis. He successfully built models that incorporated data from our different companies so simultaneous projections could effectively be made.  For a time, we owned both an HMO and several acute care hospitals.  Steve built a model to show the overall impact of patient volume to the \"System\" as well as each company individually by effectively accounting for the incidence of \"inter-company\" profits. This led us to powerful insights in negotiating with \"ourselves\" and determining HMO rates for our hospitals. Another example of Steve's formidable skill was the development of a comprehensive financial modeling of a Long Term Acute Care space rental within our Baton Rouge facility in the early 1990's, complete with ancillary revenue impacts and related overhead costing on both a marginal and fully loaded basis.  His analytic skill sets in healthcare are as powerful in relation to physician alignment and group practice management evaluations as to primary and tertiary acute care development.  Steve is an invaluable resource my current firm turns to often for our most complex projects, particularly with regard to due diligence efforts involving a need for both rigorous analytics and a thorough understanding of strategic financial planning."

She has demonstrated this skill, for example, by successfully planning for hurricanes in one of her former roles to having an HIE system stood-up and operational by a defined deadline in her new one. She has been successful in managing these groups as a result of her talent for choosing the right people to work for her or to bring in as consultants so that a cohesive team has formed once the project starts. She leads by example and has a fast learning curve meaning that she is able to learn enough new trend in relevant technical fields to provide required project guidance. The Louisiana Healthcare Quality Forum is lucky to have Cindy at the helm.

                            "text": "I've known Steve for over twenty years, both in a supervisory role and, today, in a consultant-to-consultant relationship.  Anyone looking for an industry resource for project specific services will find him a great investment with immediate, high impact payback.  Steve functions well in a team environment and has strong expertise merging financial and operational skills honed through years of strong experience allowing him to add value to any situation. His strong work ethic accomplishes the typical project ahead of schedule. Analytically, he's a brilliant talent capable of learning independently on the fly.  This quality is an extraordinarily rare advantage for a consultant in our industry, which is constantly evolving as numerous sub-fields interact. Steve rolls up his sleeves everyday and learns the latest techniques and industry rules, but I judge his strongest talent as his ability to picture an analysis and its variables in his mind before numerically painting them in exquisite, understandable detail.  Over and over again I have seen him create new financial models complex enough to take all essential variables into place, but simple to understand and use in effectively communicating with various constituents.  Several examples will suffice.  During our time working together for an IDS (\"Integrated Delivery System\") in the early to mid-1990's, Steve successfully developed complex financial models for all of the System's entities that spanned the continuum from physician clinics, reference laboratories and nursing homes, to HMOs and acute care hospitals. He demonstrated an ability to learn the specific characteristics of each of the healthcare entities' sub-market segments on the run and on an independent basis. He successfully built models that incorporated data from our different companies so simultaneous projections could effectively be made.  For a time, we owned both an HMO and several acute care hospitals.  Steve built a model to show the overall impact of patient volume to the \"System\" as well as each company individually by effectively accounting for the incidence of \"inter-company\" profits. This led us to powerful insights in negotiating with \"ourselves\" and determining HMO rates for our hospitals. Another example of Steve's formidable skill was the development of a comprehensive financial modeling of a Long Term Acute Care space rental within our Baton Rouge facility in the early 1990's, complete with ancillary revenue impacts and related overhead costing on both a marginal and fully loaded basis.  His analytic skill sets in healthcare are as powerful in relation to physician alignment and group practice management evaluations as to primary and tertiary acute care development.  Steve is an invaluable resource my current firm turns to often for our most complex projects, particularly with regard to due diligence efforts involving a need for both rigorous analytics and a thorough understanding of strategic financial planning."

She has demonstrated this skill, for example, by successfully planning for hurricanes in one of her former roles to having an HIE system stood-up and operational by a defined deadline in her new one. She has been successful in managing these groups as a result of her talent for choosing the right people to work for her or to bring in as consultants so that a cohesive team has formed once the project starts. She leads by example and has a fast learning curve meaning that she is able to learn enough new trend in relevant technical fields to provide required project guidance. The Louisiana Healthcare Quality Forum is lucky to have Cindy at the helm. I would readily endorse Cindy for any type of management position where creating and leading multi-sklled teams were the key to success."
