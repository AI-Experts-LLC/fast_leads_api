## Email Template Philosophy

### Core Principles Applied

Based on "Cold Emailing 101" best practices:

1. **Goal: Get a Response** (not book a meeting, not close a deal)
2. **Personalization at Scale**: Balance manual research with automation
3. **Three-Touch Series**: Intro → Follow-up → Breakup
4. **Under 100 Words**: Brief, focused, and buyer-centric
5. **Pattern Interruption**: Stand out from generic outreach
6. **Open-Ended Questions**: Easy yes/no responses
7. **Show Me You Know Me®**: Reference specific, relevant details

### Metrus-Specific Enhancements

From the Personalization System:

- **Persona-Based Pain Points**: Tailored to CFO, Facilities, or Sustainability priorities
- **Company-Specific Context**: References capital projects, infrastructure upgrades
- **Conversational Tone**: Natural language refined by two-stage AI process
- **Rapport Alignment**: Subject line themes match email opening sentences
- **No Sales Pitch**: Focus on relationship-building, not product pushing

---

## Three Email Series Structure

### Email #1: The Personalized Introduction
- **Goal**: Show you've done your homework + surface a relevant problem
- **Length**: 75-100 words maximum
- **CTA**: Simple yes/no question
- **Timing**: Day 1

### Email #2: The Follow-Up
- **Goal**: Resurface the first email with brevity
- **Length**: 30-50 words maximum
- **CTA**: Restate the original question
- **Timing**: 3 days after Email #1

### Email #3: The Breakup
- **Goal**: Pattern interruption + last-ditch effort
- **Length**: 50-75 words maximum
- **CTA**: Give them an easy out + humor
- **Timing**: 3-4 days after Email #2

## Subject Line Framework

### Hyper-Personalized (Tier 1 Prospects)

Based on Samantha McKenna's "Show Me You Know Me®" approach:

**Formula**: `{{Obscure_Personal_Detail}} + {{Another_Detail}} + Metrus`

**Examples**:
- "Switzerland + Le Dip Cheeseburger + Metrus"
- "Utah Jazz + Castle Solar + energy infrastructure"
- "Ohio State + HVAC modernization + healthcare"

**Why It Works**: Pattern interruption—makes them curious enough to open

---

### Personalized at Scale (Tier 2/3 Prospects)

Use dynamic variables for quick personalization:

**Campaign 1 Templates** (Professional Recognition):
```
{{FirstName}}, impressive {{achievement}}
{{FirstName}}, saw your {{project}} work
{{FirstName}}, congrats on {{recognition}}
```

**Campaign 2 Templates** (Industry Connection):
```
Fellow {{job_function}} in {{location}}
Fellow healthcare {{role}} in {{city}}
{{Industry}} energy question for you
```

**Campaign 3 Templates** (Company-Specific):
```
Question about {{Company}}'s {{topic}}
Curious about {{Hospital}}'s infrastructure
{{Company}} + {{pain_point}} question
```

**Campaign 4 Templates** (Local Connection):
```
{{FirstName}} + {{local_team}} + {{topic}}
Hope you caught the {{local_event}}
{{City}} healthcare energy leader
```

---

### Subject Line Rules

**DO**:
- ✅ Keep it 30-50 characters (mobile optimization)
- ✅ Use first name when possible
- ✅ Reference specific, relevant details
- ✅ Create curiosity without being clickbaity
- ✅ Test using "+" to break up subject lines

**DON'T**:
- ❌ Mention Metrus in the subject (save for body)
- ❌ Use sales language ("Free," "Limited time," "Offer")
- ❌ Ask for meetings in subject line
- ❌ Use all caps or excessive punctuation
- ❌ Exceed 50 characters

---

## Usage Guidelines

### Implementation Workflow

**Step 1: Segment Your Leads**
```
Tier 1 (Top 3%):
- Manual research (20+ minutes per contact)
- Hand-write each email using personalization fields
- Use hyper-personalized subject lines

Tier 2/3 (Next 17%):
- Light research (5 minutes per contact)
- Use templates with dynamic variables
- Semi-personalized subject lines
```

**Step 2: Gather Personalization Data**

Use your enrichment system to populate:
- `{{Rapport_Summary}}` - Professional recognition
- `{{Rapport_Summary_3}}` - Company-specific project
- `{{Summary_Why_Care}}` - Pain point connection
- `{{Similar_Hospital}}` - Social proof example
- `{{Achievement}}` - Recent accomplishment
- `{{Specific_Project}}` - Infrastructure project

**Step 3: Customize Per Persona**

Choose the template version that matches their detected persona:
- **Version 1** → CFO, VP Finance, Finance Director
- **Version 2** → Director Facilities, Maintenance Director, VP Plant Operations
- **Version 3** → Energy Manager, Sustainability Director, Environmental Director

**Step 4: Send Three-Email Series**

```
Day 1:  Email #1 (Personalized Introduction)
Day 4:  Email #2 (Follow-Up) - if no reply
Day 7-8: Email #3 (Breakup) - if no reply
```

**Include Other Touchpoints**:
- Day 2: LinkedIn connection request
- Day 3: Phone call attempt
- Day 5: LinkedIn InMail (if connected)
- Day 6: Phone call attempt #2

---

### A/B Testing Strategy

**Test These Variables**:

1. **Subject Lines**:
   - Campaign 1 vs Campaign 2 vs Campaign 3 vs Campaign 4
   - First name vs no first name
   - Short (<30 chars) vs Medium (30-50 chars)

2. **Body Copy**:
   - Rapport_Summary position (beginning vs middle)
   - Summary_Why_Care phrasing ("I'm sure" vs "I imagine")
   - Social proof inclusion (with vs without peer hospitals)

3. **CTAs**:
   - "Would that be worth a conversation?"
   - "Is that something you'd want to explore?"
   - "Would that interest you?"

4. **P.S. Usage**:
   - With P.S. vs without P.S.
   - Social proof P.S. vs No-pressure P.S.

5. **Timing**:
   - 3-day cadence vs 4-day cadence
   - Tuesday/Thursday send vs Monday/Wednesday send

---

### Response Handling

**If They Reply "Yes"**:
```
Great! I'll send over a few times that work this week.

In the meantime, here's a quick one-pager on how we've helped
{{Similar_Hospital}} achieve similar results: [link]

Looking forward to chatting,
[Your Name]
```

**If They Reply "Not Right Now"**:
```
No problem at all! When would be a better time to reconnect?
I'm happy to reach back out in {{3/6/12}} months.

Best,
[Your Name]
```

**If They Reply "No"**:
```
Thanks for letting me know! If anything changes or you'd like to
chat down the road, feel free to reach out.

Best,
[Your Name]
```

**If They Ask Questions**:
```
Great question! [Answer their question concisely]

Would it make sense to hop on a quick 15-minute call to discuss
how this would work specifically for {{Hospital}}?

Here's my calendar: [link]

### Key Success Metrics

**Track These KPIs**:

| Metric | Target | Notes |
|--------|--------|-------|
| Open Rate | 30-50% | Varies by persona/seniority |
| Reply Rate | 10-20% | Includes any response (yes/no/later) |
| Positive Reply Rate | 3-8% | "Yes, let's talk" responses |
| Breakup Email Reply Rate | 5-12% | Often higher than Email #1 |
| Meeting Booked Rate | 2-5% | From initial cold outreach |

**Benchmark by Persona**:
- CFO: Lower reply rate (20-30% open), but higher conversion
- Director Facilities: Higher reply rate (30-40% open), moderate conversion
- Sustainability: Moderate reply rate (25-35% open), high conversion

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

**❌ Don't Do This**:

1. **Writing About Yourself**:
   ```
   ❌ "Metrus Energy is the leading provider of energy solutions..."
   ✅ "I work with facilities directors at hospitals like Mayo..."
   ```

2. **Generic Pain Points**:
   ```
   ❌ "I'm sure you're looking to save money..."
   ✅ "I imagine you've faced constant firefighting with old equipment..."
   ```

3. **Asking for Too Much**:
   ```
   ❌ "Can we schedule a 60-minute discovery call?"
   ✅ "Would that be worth a 15-minute conversation?"
   ```

4. **No Personalization**:
   ```
   ❌ "Dear Facilities Director,"
   ✅ "Hi Mike, I saw the chiller plant modernization you completed..."
   ```

5. **Too Long**:
   ```
   ❌ 200+ word emails explaining everything
   ✅ 75-100 words focused on one problem
   ```

6. **Sales-Heavy Subject Lines**:
   ```
   ❌ "Cut Your Energy Costs by 40% - Free Consultation"
   ✅ "Mike, saw the chiller plant upgrade"
   ```

## Advanced Techniques

### The LinkedIn + Email Combo

**Day 1**: Send Email #1
**Day 2**: View their LinkedIn profile (they get notification)
**Day 3**: Send connection request with custom note:

```
Hi {{FirstName}},

Just sent you an email about {{Hospital}}'s infrastructure—figured
I'd connect here too. Would love to hear your thoughts!

Best,
[Your Name]
```

**Day 4**: Send Email #2
**Day 5**: If they accept connection, send LinkedIn message:

```
Thanks for connecting, {{FirstName}}!

Following up on my email about funding infrastructure upgrades
through guaranteed energy savings. Is that something worth exploring?
```

---

### The Video Touch

For Tier 1 prospects, try adding a personalized video:

**Email #1.5 (Between Email #1 and #2)**:

```
Subject: Quick video for you, {{FirstName}}

Hi {{FirstName}},

I made you a quick 60-second video explaining how {{Similar_Hospital}}
achieved [specific result] with zero capital: [Loom link]

Thought it might be easier than reading another email!

Worth a conversation?

Best,
[Your Name]
```

**Video Script** (60 seconds):
1. "Hi {{FirstName}}, this is [Your Name] from Metrus Energy"
2. "I know you're busy, so I made this quick video..."
3. [Show case study slide from {{Similar_Hospital}}]
4. "Here's how they achieved [X result] with zero capital..."
5. "Would this work for {{Hospital}}? Let's chat."
6. "Reply to my email or grab time here: [calendar link]"

---

### The Referral Ask

If you know someone at their organization:

```
Subject: {{Mutual_Connection}} suggested I reach out

Hi {{FirstName}},

{{Mutual_Connection}} mentioned you're leading the charge on
{{Hospital}}'s infrastructure upgrades.

[Continue with Version 1/2/3 body based on persona]
```

---

### The Event Follow-Up

If they're speaking at or attending an event:

```
Subject: Catching your talk at {{Event}}?

Hi {{FirstName}},

Saw you're speaking at {{Event}} next week about {{Topic}}—
excited to hear your perspective on {{Specific_Point}}.

[Continue with Version 1/2/3 body based on persona]

P.S. If you're free at the event, I'd love to say hi in person!
```

## Conclusion

### Remember: The Goal is a Response, Not a Meeting

**These emails work because they**:
1. ✅ Show you've done your research (personalization)
2. ✅ Address real pain points (relevance)
3. ✅ Offer clear value (zero CapEx, guaranteed results)
4. ✅ Make it easy to reply (yes/no questions)
5. ✅ Remove pressure (P.S. clauses, humor, easy outs)
6. ✅ Stand out from generic outreach (pattern interruption)

**The Formula**:
```
Personalization + Relevance + Brevity + Humor + Easy CTA = Response
```

**Success Metrics to Celebrate**:
- Any reply (yes, no, or later) is a win
- Opens and clicks show engagement
- "Not right now" replies are future pipeline
- "No" replies help your sender reputation

**Test, Learn, Iterate**:
- A/B test subject lines and body copy
- Track what works by persona
- Refine based on your unique audience
- Keep emails under 100 words
- Always provide an easy out

**Questions? Feedback? Ideas?**

Document your learnings and share what works. Cold email is an art and a science—these templates are your starting point, but your market will teach you what resonates.

**Good luck, and happy emailing! 📧**
